I ordered a Schubb brand capo that's much easier to operate and doesn't smash the strings like a brute because the pressure is adjustable.  The only drawback to the Schubb is you can't clip it to the headstock, a convenience that's important to a lot of professional musicians.  I'm keeping both, if I need the convenience of this clip on style I'll use it.

{"reviewText":"After playing for years with Elixir Nanoweb 80/20's, I decided to experiment with a few different coated strings. I tried the Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze, Dean Markley Alchemy Gold Phosphor (now discontinued) and these EXP16s. Ultimately, I preferred the Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze the best, but the EXP16 are cheaper and the difference didn't warrant the extra cost, so I decided to stick with these for now.  I wasn't a fan of the Alchemys because of their rough texture and high tension. The EXP16s are smooth and have a very playable tension, although not as smooth and easy as the Elixir 80/20's.  As far as longevity, these seem to last me about 2 months, which is on par with other coated strings I've tried, except for the Elixir 80/20's which average about 3 months. Uncoated strings last me about a month.Depending on the style of play, I prefer brighter or warmer strings, but I'd rank the EXP16s somewhere in the middle. It's a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle. Even though they don't project as well as the Elixir 80/20s, they have a very agreeable tone without some of the harsh overtones. For live use with a pickup I'd be more inclined to use the Elixirs, but for unplugged or mic'ed use I like the tone of these.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"playing year elixir nanoweb decided

{"reviewText":"As far as tried and true distortion pedals go, this is really just average. The filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion. Compared to other distortion pedals, it really fails in this regard. However, if used as a fuzz pedal instead, it truly shines, since this is really what it is. Does it have distortion? Yes. Is it valuable as such? Not in my opinion. It isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that. Another gripe I have is the 9 volt slot. Most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply. Not so with this pedal. You are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries, which sux IMO, especially since I run all my pedals off an adapter chain.Anyways, while this is fun to play with, you should definitely consider the sound you are going for.

{"reviewText":"Behringer is a problematic company for me. Some of their stuff has been useful far beyond its modest, entry-level pricing (e.g. A-500 Studio Amplifier, UCA-202 DAC, Eurorack UB-502 mini-mixer)...and some of their stuff hasn't served me well at all (e.g. GM-108 amplifier, BTR-2000 rack tuner).Across the Web, reviews for the TO-800 are uniformly favorable. Based on this, I purchased one instead of paying many times more for an Ibanez TS-808. This proved to be a good decision. The TO-800 produces exactly the sort of sound enhancement that made \"seasick green\" justly famous: creamy smooth to raunchy depending on my whim.The same sound for a lot less money? What's the catch? I'm a musical hobbyist. The TO-800 will sit safely on my office floor and, most likely, never be actuated by my foot. The Behringer's shoddy plastic case and flimsy little control knobs, for me, are not liabilities. If I was a gigging musician on the other hand, I'd want the tank-solid construction of \"the real thing\" and its additional cost would be well justified.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"behringer problematic company stuff useful far beyond modest entry level pricing e g studio amplifier uca dac eurorack ub mini mixer stuff served well

{"reviewText":"Brough this for trying \"electric\" feels on the acoustic guitar, and don't want to waste too much money on electric acoustic (preamp) guitar or big amp if I don't like the \"eFeels\". After researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it, I decided to give it a try.  I didn't expect too much on $20 amp, but surprisingly, it positively gives me more than I ask for.  I also brough it with the adaptor, which is great to save $$ for long runs, and I don't have to worry about the battery for home practices.  It is adorable out of the box; it looks like a lovely toy, but it works professionally based on its 10w amp.  I don't care much about the manufactor's suggested modes, basically, I just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds I like in different songs on guitar / uke.  I like the small size that won't take too much space on my tiny room, it's cute to look at, and it is practical too!I had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when I used a poor pickup; however, when I changed to another one, I can turn the volume as high as I want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup.  I almost thought that was an issue from the amp, luckily, I have two different pickups to try it deeply.  After using the better pickup, the amp doesn't have any issue yet.  I have used for few times, so I don't know about its longevity yet!One more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar's sound itself won't be muted, but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp; anyway, it's a great feature to have.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"brough trying electric feel acoustic guitar want waste much money

{"reviewText":"First of all this is NOT the best microphone ever made.  But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected.  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration.  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go.  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job.  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers.  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know.These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs.  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly.  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq.  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up.  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58.  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen.  Another strength of these is durability.  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall.  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug. One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue.  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters.  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's.  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these.  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price.  You can pay more and get less.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"first best microphone ever made cost certainly expected give star microphone period without even taking low cost consideration

{"reviewText":"First of all, don't expect any new tuner to work as a \"drop-in\" replacement.  Drop-in replacements for tuners basically don't exist unless you have the exact type of tuner, and in that case, you aren't doing an \"upgrade\".  You'll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer.  Or, if there's a Guitar Center or guitar shop nearby, have a tech do the work for you.These tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive, with a nice vintage look.  They would look great on a either a Strat or Tele.  Unfortunately, my Squier Bullet had a slightly smaller headstock, which meant that the low E string's tuner was too large - the wing for the screw hung over the edge.  Therefore, I will not be installing these on my guitar, but that is not the fault of the tuner.Functionally, these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate, and I've heard the hold tune just fine.  Check the back of your headstock for fit, but if that's a \"go\", these are a great option!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"first expect new tuner work drop replacement drop replacement tuner basically exist unless exact type tuner case upgrade likely need bore additional diameter peg hole drill press tapered reamer guitar center guitar shop nearby tech work tuner arrived quickly attractive nice vintage look would look great either strat tele unfortunately squier bullet slightly smaller headstock meant low e string tuner large wing screw hung edge therefore installing guitar fault tuner functionally one easiest tuning key rotate heard hold tune fine check back headstock fit go great option","words":["first","expect","new","tuner","work","drop","replacement","drop","replacement","tuner","basically","exist","unless","exact","type","tuner","case","upgrade","likely","need","bore","additional","diameter","peg","hole","drill","press","tapered","reamer","guitar","center","guitar","shop","nearby","tech","work","tuner","arrived","quickly","attractive","nice","vintage","look","would","look","great","either","strat","tele","unfortunately","squier","bullet","slightly","smaller","headstock","meant","low","e","string","tuner","large","wing","screw","hung","edge","therefore","installing","guitar","fault","tuner","functionally","one","easiest","tuning","key","rotate","heard","hold","tune","fine","check","back","headstock","fit","go","great","option"],"filtered_words":["first","expect","new","tuner","work","drop","replacement","drop","replacement","tuner","basically","exist","unless","exact","type","tuner","case","upgrade","likely","need","bore","additional","diameter","peg","hole","drill","press","tapered","reamer","guitar","center","guitar","shop","nearby","tech","work","tuner","arrived","quickly","attractive","nice","vintage","look","look","great","either","strat","tele","unfortunately","squier","bullet","slightly","smaller","headstock","meant","low","e","string","tuner","large","wing","screw","hung","edge","therefore","installing","guitar","fault","tuner","functionally","one","easiest","tuning","key","rotate","heard","hold","tune","fine","check","back","headstock","fit","go","great","option"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[1,21,50,89,309,357,392,419,490,585,750,752,815,971,1064,1240,1315,1342,1349,1403,1431,1451,1480,1537,1573,1602,1910,1955,1998,2022,2023,2056,2368,2369,2389,2488,2643,2833,3038,3131,3187,3228,3348,3370,3391,3411,3427,3430,3526,3536,3550,3577,3595,3673,3691,3901,3921,3989,4081,4126,4193,4251,4303,4527,4573,4613,4785,4800,4803,4864,4897,4939],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[1,21,50,89,309,357,392,419,490,585,750,752,815,971,1064,1240,1315,1342,1349,1403,1431,1451,1480,1537,1573,1602,1910,1955,1998,2022,2023,2056,2368,2369,2389,2488,2643,2833,3038,3131,3187,3228,3348,3370,3391,3411,3427,3430,3526,3536,3550,3577,3595,3673,3691,3901,3921,3989,4081,4126,4193,4251,4303,4527,4573,4613,4785,4800,4803,4864,4897,4939],"values":[3.5978483621681643,7.290292882446597,6.597145701886651,14.380359559638407,3.207924511271212,3.5802112206820573,4.736393361171645,4.368668581046328,5.19315176366736,2.6363325322890736,2.4018482407144863,4.959536912485855,1.1804105805241405,5.031510412110944,3.389764256444186,2.3384980883732744,3.6049912496805447,2.6908533711674902,3.8380403299841572,2.494502336849856,2.6751723656053374,2.21422660842975,2.9671067477956488,1.9792003244098373,4.959536912485855,6.4636143092621285,5.868907201515436,5.304377398777584,4.805386232658597,3.4102029241214598,4.517704160206816,4.205765110109475,2.844285918109308,3.7981237225787146,2.601569673640224,4.376390627140238,5.770467128702183,3.333569698100544,7.570329155872419,4.384172767582293,4.49127090313866,4.572763937389843,2.5075744184172084,1.9506964829791245,3.7067739439904868,5.356010457379283,4.440412485905169,2.48510156256515,3.358467249722271,4.582242681344387,3.6014134283326604,7.7218492476354905,4.758866217023703,4.179957226153602,3.6640489993241454,3.9735128425970245,4.4570795383903805,2.566704941644031,5.125329167328599,3.404320554218393,3.163158497401505,5.046548289475485,8.491540889446348,2.6904926307259824,5.770467128702183,3.8702270164800585,4.0432461806117,4.316222105673785,3.105274161177455,3.5978483621681643,1.583182617697721,4.591961124764543]}}

I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you, Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately, so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze, but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these, and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it.

{"reviewText":"First, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get.  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products.  Solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound.  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal, resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found.1. Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out.  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it.  Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control.

{"reviewText":"Flatwound? Ribbon wound?  It's all the same, no squeak, slick, jazzer mellow in tone.  It's a sound that many would like to acheive.  But why not round wounds?  Round wounds give a bit of grip, round wounds also have more surface area and are louder.  Okay, but I have a pickup, want the mellower tone, sans finger noise.  It's important for my playing to not have finger noise.I have the Les Paul for harder edged music, but the archtop jazzbox pleads for a mellower tone, hence the flats.I have a couple of friends who are really great Jazz guitar stylists, they both use D'Addario Chromes - over nickel, so I thought I would try them out.  Nice, buttery smooth and I couldn't really recognized the difference over nickel flats, except the price, and the wear seemed a bit better.Wear and tear is not really a factor for me, as I change out strings every 3 to 6 weeks depending on how much I'm playing.Not ready to take the plunge?  It is a different feel, if not, try half rounds.  They're a hybrid of both, less finger noise, a bit more surface area, hence output.  Output is not a problem if you are amplified.Check them out.  I use the medium gauge, with a 13 high E, the G is wound also.  Finger style or with a heavy Dunlap tortex pick, the attack noise is also reduced with the flats.  I like them alot.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"flatwound ribbon wound squeak slick jazzer mellow tone sound many would like acheive round wound round wound give bit grip round wound also

{"reviewText":"For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound. It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling. But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight.To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music.

{"reviewText":"Great bang for the buck clone of a Tech 21 GT-2. This pedal does not have the build quality of the GT-2 but the controls are identical and it sounds darn good (especially for the pocket change they charge).  I have not done a gut-shot comparison of the two pedals so I can not comment on how close the actual circuits and components are.  The TM300 is more than just a distortion box.  It's more like a preamp.  I find that it does a very convincing mid scooped Twin type of clean as well as a decent Marshall type growl.  I find the Mesa to be the least authentic though it is not an unpleasant distortion by any means- it just doesn't sound like a Mesa imho.  If you are looking for triple rec distortion there are probably better dirt boxes for that.  I actually have the same criticism of my Tech 21 Tri-AC (really excellent pedal!)  The TM300 works well running into an amp and because it can simulate a mic'd cab it can also be run directly into a PA or mixer and bypass the amp completely. This thing actually takes other pedals reasonably well.  It can really breath new life into a mediocre practice amp (or any solid state). It can also be stowed in a bag easily enough so that you don't have to lug a backup amp to gigs.  I find it much more realistic sounding than digital modelers but it doesn't quite 100% replicate the sound and touch sensativity of a tube amp being pushed (they haven't invented that yet in my opinion). It doesn't replace a tube amp for me personally but if you are contemplating running straight into the PA because lugging your amp is impractical this is a no-brainer. Five stars for what it does at this price.  If you are a hobbyist or weekend warrior this pedal will cover the bases.  If you make your living doing live performances (or if price is not factored into your decision making) I would advise you to pony up the extra money for the Tech 21 product because their overall build quality is much higher (with regards to the enclosure, switch, knobs, jacks), their customer service is top-shelf and they are engineered/manufactured right in NYC.  I own three Tech 21 pedals and previously owned their Trademark 60 amp and I can attest to the difference in overall build quality between their products and Behringer's.  Sound-wise they are very very similar though and I DO have much love for these inexpensive Behringer pedals.  I own close to a dozen of them and I have not encountered a single malfunction in more than 2 years.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"great bang buck clone tech gt pedal build quality gt control

{"reviewText":"I always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  Some don't like the sound, others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  Some say that the grip is good.  Here's my take -- for what it's worth.  I've listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  Round and flat wound strings.  My general take is that these picks give a better, fuller, rounder bigger tone overall.  Compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  It's a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or a combination of both.  Also note, I play with the rounded edge, not the tip.  So the grip in the center of these doesn't quite fit my grip style but it's still ok.  I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  I've been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what I've found so far.  I find that they stand out, sound wise, for the guitars I'm currently playing.  The process of finding the \"right\" pick is never ending and changes over time.

{"reviewText":"I bought eleven of these in order to hang a bunch of my guitars and I found them to be extremely simple and quick to install.  The included anchors work perfectly and went in without issue, leaving the String Swing solidly connected to the wall.If you are hanging a lot of guitars, making two rows (one high and one low) seems to be the best option.  I spaced the hangers eighteen inches apart and the guitars I put up look nice and have a good, tight spacing.  I uploaded two pictures of my wall after I had installed nine of the hangers and I couldn't be more pleased with the look... the pictures are uploaded on this product page.  I have put up the other two hangers since I uploaded the pictures, so I will have to do new pictures, but the ones that I put up will give you a good representation of the look you will get with these.The easiest way to hang a lot of these is to use a laser level such as theBlack & Decker BDL100AV All-In-One SureGrip Laser Leveland a long cloth tape measure that you can tack to the wall.  I just went down the wall making dots directly on the line, drilled quick pilot holes and nine of the string swings were installed in about 20 - 30 minutes.  I think that this is the quickest and easiest way to get a professional-looking installation.As far as the performance of the hangers goes, what is there to say?  The included anchors are big enough to keep the wooden backplate securely fastened to the wall and the hanger screws into a metal receptacle in the middle of it.  As long as you make sure that you tighten the hanger properly, you will be in good shape.I DO NOT, however, recommend buying theString Swing Home and Studio Wall Bumper Brown, as they are complete garbage and fall off the wall almost immediately.EDIT: I put the other hangers up now and did NOT drill pilot holes.  The anchors are made in such a way as to be nailed into the wall without using a pilot hole.  Just mark the positions, use a hammer to nail the anchors up to the screw portion, then screw them in.  It took about 1 minute to put a new hanger up, but this was partially due to the fact that I was able to use a level and put it against the bottom of the other hangers to get the line.  At any rate, you do not need to drill pilot holes; just nail and go!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought eleven order hang bunch guitar found extremely simple quick install included anchor

The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead.","overall":1.0,"label":0,"clean_text":"bought one soft medium hard wedgie rubber pick even though colour right hard soft soft felt exactly fact medium hardest bunch packaging error idea fact stiffness come one colour colour right lead think something wrong manufacturing check get sound wise rubber really remove treble acoustic guitar making sound really dull muted lot friction rubber string think idea strumming reason think using want reduce noise frankly would much control used finger instead","words":["bought","one","soft","medium","hard","wedgie","rubber","pick","even","though","colour","right","hard","soft","soft","felt","exactly","fact","medium","hardest","bunch","packaging","error","idea","fact","stiffness","come","one","colour","colour","right","lead","think","something","wrong","manufacturing","check","get","sound","wise","rubber","really","remove","treble","acoustic","guitar","making","sound","really","dull","muted","lot","friction","rubber","string","think","idea","strumming","reason","think","using","want","reduce","noise","frankly","would","much","control","used","finger","instead"],"filtered_words":["bought","one","soft","medium","hard","wedgie","rubber","pick","even","though","colour","right","hard","soft","soft","felt","exactly","fact","medium","hardest","bunch","packaging","error","idea","fact","stiffness","come","one","colour","colour","right","lead","think","something","wrong","manufacturing","check","get","sound","wise","rubber","really","remove","treble","acoustic","guitar","making","sound","really","dull","muted","lot","friction","rubber","string","think","idea","strumming","reason","think","using","want","reduce","noise","frankly","much","control","used","finger","instead"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[110,125,356,479,524,815,867,958,960,1166,1208,1406,1512,1790,1842,1964,2023,2061,2080,2096,2207,2215,2335,2372,2464,2576,2712,2739,2834,2944,2968,3066,3159,3385,3442,3725,3796,3846,3901,4099,4112,4363,4426,4470,4527,4605,4635,4646,4673,4803,4826,4887,4897,4943],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[110,125,356,479,524,815,867,958,960,1166,1208,1406,1512,1790,1842,1964,2023,2061,2080,2096,2207,2215,2335,2372,2464,2576,2712,2739,2834,2944,2968,3066,3159,3385,3442,3725,3796,3846,3901,4099,4112,4363,4426,4470,4527,4605,4635,4646,4673,4803,4826,4887,4897,4943],"values":[4.945743590353519,5.753258325659066,4.179957226153602,4.72534352498506,1.840481422899865,2.360821161048281,4.682326139901369,7.855870668201411,2.164629667290378,2.713823092839279,3.227389846059315,2.1149505782573685,3.474151648721733,4.830191118490891,5.835005649839755,2.505184931019827,4.517704160206816,3.7597394795703996,4.238990757737795,3.4899998409617567,5.407561635012815,7.091687154355699,7.824484965967132,2.2551972907801803,4.273358401242003,3.3013088358823226,2.287305809188598,4.973523154460595,4.238990757737795,3.6452160509910536,2.4064092939894848,6.345831273605746,4.148606696269526,2.822744074334553,8.131438072927516,5.247218984937636,11.724980588136987,3.100638140420171,3.9735128425970245,10.257275614616118,3.573410052238122,17.711995563980118,1.548205865108894,4.973523154460595,1.3452463153629912,1.9624167136570156,6.4636143092621285,2.1101157582027854,4.266389731925909,1.0350913870591516,2.801656512714457,3.3119472340873783,1.583182617697721,2.427163725458931]}}

I liked the Satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the AC30, and delay feature is a lot of fun.  But I had serious questions about the Classic Rock Amplug.  Why did have only a 4-star review on Amazon - among the lowest for any of the fabulous Amplug products.  Would it be only a \"one trick pony\"?Well, I have to tell you, I was completely blown away by how great the Classic Rock Amplug is, and I'm now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews.  I've tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier, and many pedal users are seeking what they call a \"Marshall-in-a-box\".  In other words, they want a effects pedal that will single-handedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of Marshalls.  Believe it or not, the Vox Classic Rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a \"Marshall\" sound as I can imagine.  And it comes in a small, plastic headphone amplifier that runs on 2 AAA batteries and costs all of $39.99.Functionally, the Classic Rock Amplug is the same as the AC30 - three dials for gain, tone, and volume, an aux in jack (for MP3 players), a headphone jack, and an on/off switch.  But that's where the similarities end.  While the excellent AC30 model simulates the boxy, sparkly sound of a tube amplifier, the Classic Rock packs some PUNCH.  The low end presence on this thing (even through a $20 set of entry-level Sony headphones from Target) is significantly greater than on the AC30.  More importantly, the sound doesn't deteriorate with higher volumes.  There are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones, but most of them become a static-filled mess as soon as you turn up the volume.  Amazingly, the tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap, and the \"overdrive\" is controlled through analog circuitry, with amazing clarity.But the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug (and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here) are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob.  Several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak, or claimed that there were no clean tones.  Yet, with both my Les Paul and a Strat, I was able to set the Volume at around 6-8 and the gain at about level 2 and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume.  If any dirt was remaining, a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem.  Even better, playing a Strat into the Classic Rock with the gain set somewhere between 2 to 4 actually created a Tubescreamer-like blues tone!  This tone was one of the audio demos offered on Vox's website, but I didn't believe it for myself until I plugged the Classic Rock in and dialed in that tone.Long story short, the Classic Rock is extremely powerful, but more verstaile than I thought.  It can do the high-gain Marshall tones I expected, but also offers a wide array of clean or slightly-overdriven tones.  It might even be more versatile than the AC30 Amplug, though I remain pretty loyal to the AC30.  The good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both.  Highly recommend the Classic Rock - 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought vox amplug ac loved much probably doubled tripled amount time play guitar loved much went got expensive joe

{"reviewText":"I bought this mixer in order to combine my bass guitar with an mp3 player for silent practice at home. Bass into one channel, iPod into another, headphones out.It works!  There are other solutions to this dilemma.  Pocket-sized headphone amps, and so on.  But they're a) more expensive and b) kind of junky and c) come equipped with built-in effects and amp models which I do not want.  YMMV.)So what's the Behringer XENYX 502 like in this use scenario?1. The blue power light is blinding.  First thing I did was put some masking tape on it so that it didn't prevent me from seeing the knobs on the board.2. Speaking of those knobs, they seem a little rickety.  Be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly.  I worry that the knobs won't stand up to that kind of treatment for long.3.  There's no on/off switch, so you'll wind up pulling the power out of the back of the unit when it's not in use.  Strange for this particular usage scenario.Overall, I think this unit is a great value for the money.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought mixer order combine bass guitar mp player silent practice home bass one channel ipod another headphone work solution dilemma pocket sized headphone amp expensive b kind junky c come equipped built effect amp model want ymmv behringer xenyx like use scenario blue power light blinding first thing put masking tape prevent seeing knob board speaking knob seem little rickety careful jamming gig bag repeatedly worry knob stand kind treatment long switch wind pulling power back unit use strange particular usage scenario overall think unit great value money","words":["bought","mixer","order","combine","bass","guitar","mp","player","silent","practice","home","bass","one","channel","ipod","another","headphone","work","solution","dilemma","pocket","sized","headphone","amp","expensive","b","kind","junky","c","come","equipped","built","effect","amp","model","want","ymmv","behringer","xenyx","like","use","scenario","blue","power","light","blinding","first","thing","put","masking","tape","prevent","seeing","knob","board","speaking","knob","seem","little","rickety","careful","jamming","gig","bag","repeatedly","worry","knob","stand","kind","treatment","long","switch","wind","pulling","power","back","unit","use","strange","particular","usage","scenario","overall","think","unit","great","value","money"],"filtered_words":["bought","mixer","order","combine","bass","guitar","mp","player","silent","practice","home","bass","one","channel","ipod","another","headphone","work","solution","dilemma","pocket","sized","headphone","amp","expensive","b","kind","junky","c","come","equipped","built","effect","amp","model","want","ymmv","behringer","xenyx","like","use","scenario","blue","power","light","blinding","first","thing","put","masking","tape","prevent","seeing","knob","board","speaking","knob","seem","little","rickety","careful","jamming","gig","bag","repeatedly","worry","knob","stand","kind","treatment","long","switch","wind","pulling","power","back","unit","use","strange","particular","usage","scenario","overall","think","unit","great","value","money"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[12,133,173,226,346,415,542,642,655,696,748,750,764,768,793,815,955,978,1044,1103,1226,1324,1335,1344,1403,1480,1590,1604,1611,1720,1764,1791,1864,1886,1964,1987,2102,2256,2335,2403,2454,2478,2558,2588,2712,2762,3012,3015,3056,3166,3252,3330,3343,3365,3430,3538,3689,3768,3799,3857,3871,3904,3984,4159,4165,4280,4351,4376,4430,4439,4527,4592,4646,4803,4926,4929,4992,4994],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[12,133,173,226,346,415,542,642,655,696,748,750,764,768,793,815,955,978,1044,1103,1226,1324,1335,1344,1403,1480,1590,1604,1611,1720,1764,1791,1864,1886,1964,1987,2102,2256,2335,2403,2454,2478,2558,2588,2712,2762,3012,3015,3056,3166,3252,3330,3343,3365,3430,3538,3689,3768,3799,3857,3871,3904,3984,4159,4165,4280,4351,4376,4430,4439,4527,4592,4646,4803,4926,4929,4992,4994],"values":[3.5942959605637967,2.6593115982677484,4.49127090313866,4.6210825146606505,4.3534011089155396,3.4431894231177664,3.23478815354076,7.89587200161475,6.671253674040373,5.3418761229330975,4.424018676129493,1.2009241203572432,4.959536912485855,3.576720815742289,4.118209219085155,1.1804105805241405,3.1935701978195286,4.186347024252373,6.8681693122496945,2.9172349177554757,3.4804608179149983,2.952068870431108,6.344835645628604,3.8290312600417913,2.494502336849856,2.9671067477956488,1.653464542587499,3.1115196406077055,6.862136125170843,2.854387014095812,3.4250620385252097,5.016695326325803,5.709842506885749,2.4461057959880055,2.505184931019827,5.680854970012496,3.5802112206820573,4.7475666617697705,2.608161655322377,3.381131109299483,3.205517771240647,8.28231094439346,4.72534352498506,3.277778338472128,2.287305809188598,4.563374197040004,5.978106493480428,6.058149201153965,6.149991419613667,2.648653016677114,4.054419481209825,1.2895854682574375,4.1610292162680835,3.0417976403972378,2.48510156256515,4.399921124550432,5.835005649839755,4.3534011089155396,3.958088372271393,2.152815183876615,2.5075744184172084,2.5354719219540995,3.8290312600417913,7.156761489822074,3.9229970524601225,3.401392294439305,3.9529993027639216,2.931754229079929,5.061815761606273,5.407561635012815,1.3452463153629912,4.026716878660489,2.1101157582027854,1.0350913870591516,4.71163789863181,4.49127090313866,6.8383077587035395,6.402989687445694]}}
{"reviewText":"I bought this power supply for in home use - I don't do too much gigging or recording, so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around. The product works very well; I'm able to power 5 of my pedals easily. The cords are plenty long in length, however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other (i.e. having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal). However, that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product. I haven't had to use any of the special adapters though, but I plan on getting a Line 6 DL-4, so having the Line 6 adapter is a great added touch. Best of all, all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home. I've been using this product for months now and have no complaints. You can't beat the price.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought power supply home use much gigging recording primarily used practicing messing around product work well able power pedal easily cord plenty long length however bit difficult chain together longer pedal shorter one without two pedal right next e wah pedal next standard size pedal however minor complaint way effect usability product use special adapter though plan getting line dl line adapter great added touch best power need pedal take one outlet spot home using product month complaint beat price","words":["bought","power","supply","home","use","much","gigging","recording","primarily","used","practicing","messing","around","product","work","well","able","power","pedal","easily","cord","plenty","long","length","however","bit","difficult","chain","together","longer","pedal","shorter","one","without","two","pedal","right","next","e","wah","pedal","next","standard","size","pedal","however","minor","complaint","way","effect","usability","product","use","special","adapter","though","plan","getting","line","dl","line","adapter","great","added","touch","best","power","need","pedal","take","one","outlet","spot","home","using","product","month","complaint","beat","price"],"filtered_words":["bought","power","supply","home","use","much","gigging","recording","primarily","used","practicing","messing","around","product","work","well","able","power","pedal","easily","cord","plenty","long","length","however","bit","difficult","chain","together","longer","pedal","shorter","one","without","two","pedal","right","next","e","wah","pedal","next","standard","size","pedal","however","minor","complaint","way","effect","usability","product","use","special","adapter","though","plan","getting","line","dl","line","adapter","great","added","touch","best","power","need","pedal","take","one","outlet","spot","home","using","product","month","complaint","beat","price"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[133,157,309,447,524,659,741,750,763,815,855,860,911,960,1055,1123,1182,1197,1226,1324,1351,1537,1712,1738,1790,1953,1989,2196,2211,2465,2540,2569,2809,2889,2946,2967,2995,3056,3192,3273,3300,3312,3365,3385,3496,3503,3550,3599,3803,3904,3946,3981,4043,4099,4391,4485,4525,4527,4605,4609,4646,4728,4790],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[133,157,309,447,524,659,741,750,763,815,855,860,911,960,1055,1123,1182,1197,1226,1324,1351,1537,1712,1738,1790,1953,1989,2196,2211,2465,2540,2569,2809,2889,2946,2967,2995,3056,3192,3273,3300,3312,3365,3385,3496,3503,3550,3599,3803,3904,3946,3981,4043,4099,4391,4485,4525,4527,4605,4609,4646,4728,4790],"values":[2.6593115982677484,1.3764038509398002,3.207924511271212,6.318313564128998,1.840481422899865,3.893868779537099,3.4102029241214598,1.2009241203572432,2.4804341095176548,2.360821161048281,2.6514116391161937,5.475002915808347,5.9996668825964115,2.164629667290378,4.192777914582663,4.682326139901369,6.514634533201576,2.5416409729808147,3.4804608179149983,2.952068870431108,4.032196344425115,1.9792003244098373,4.032196344425115,1.676122566480083,2.4150955592454455,5.709842506885749,2.468859906236518,2.9483444713401257,3.437110377041384,7.312946411031376,3.163158497401505,3.003755014951387,5.344382733391283,3.3173091772287635,4.482612840395546,3.372571855903813,4.112239052098651,9.224987129420501,3.068686540613569,7.429484227279327,4.015847206423585,4.015847206423585,6.0835952807944755,2.822744074334553,3.4523778491721724,12.364279907266127,3.6014134283326604,6.700198000103509,4.703603538348654,2.5354719219540995,4.482612840395546,4.49127090313866,2.5232468308248404,3.419091871538706,2.3415329920684287,2.9998334412982057,6.933617938507864,1.3452463153629912,1.9624167136570156,5.452013397583649,2.1101157582027854,2.5342426654993697,4.032196344425115]}}

{"reviewText":"I bought this stand primarily to hold my Epiphone Les Paul. I have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the Hercules. The stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs. There is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands. I can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues. I plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar. I like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place.I strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there, the extra cost is well worth the investment. I bought this at my local guitar shop for $40 after looking into it, the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while I was there.UPDATE 11/5/12- A few weeks ago, I bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers. I usually buy locally, but the deal here was great. The stand is worth the price and more.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought stand primarily hold epiphone le paul owned cheaper stand built well hercules stand hold guitar place neck bottom guitar rest padding stand leg room movement guitar like fin stand also move guitar stand room room without issue plan buying another one hold rather large acoustic guitar like stand completely adjustable lock place strongly suggest stand heavier guitar rather cheaper stand extra cost well worth investment bought local guitar shop looking manager guitar shop recommended people update week ago bought second one seeing amazon price lower local retailer usually buy locally deal great stand worth price","words":["bought","stand","primarily","hold","epiphone","le","paul","owned","cheaper","stand","built","well","hercules","stand","hold","guitar","place","neck","bottom","guitar","rest","padding","stand","leg","room","movement","guitar","like","fin","stand","also","move","guitar","stand","room","room","without","issue","plan","buying","another","one","hold","rather","large","acoustic","guitar","like","stand","completely","adjustable","lock","place","strongly","suggest","stand","heavier","guitar","rather","cheaper","stand","extra","cost","well","worth","investment","bought","local","guitar","shop","looking","manager","guitar","shop","recommended","people","update","week","ago","bought","second","one","seeing","amazon","price","lower","local","retailer","usually","buy","locally","deal","great","stand","worth","price"],"filtered_words":["bought","stand","primarily","hold","epiphone","le","paul","owned","cheaper","stand","built","well","hercules","stand","hold","guitar","place","neck","bottom","guitar","rest","padding","stand","leg","room","movement","guitar","like","fin","stand","also","move","guitar","stand","room","room","without","issue","plan","buying","another","one","hold","rather","large","acoustic","guitar","like","stand","completely","adjustable","lock","place","strongly","suggest","stand","heavier","guitar","rather","cheaper","stand","extra","cost","well","worth","investment","bought","local","guitar","shop","looking","manager","guitar","shop","recommended","people","update","week","ago","bought","second","one","seeing","amazon","price","lower","local","retailer","usually","buy","locally","deal","great","stand","worth","price"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[80,122,157,228,230,294,494,552,750,815,860,1123,1279,1282,1290,1323,1390,1433,1494,1562,1616,1652,1699,1738,1801,1886,1896,2022,2389,2478,2545,2631,2708,2816,2837,2968,2990,3024,3030,3159,3166,3269,3330,3403,3427,3501,3502,3766,3792,3967,4043,4134,4210,4232,4256,4263,4376,4420,4430,4490,4597,4646,4679,4803],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,8.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[80,122,157,228,230,294,494,552,750,815,860,1123,1279,1282,1290,1323,1390,1433,1494,1562,1616,1652,1699,1738,1801,1886,1896,2022,2389,2478,2545,2631,2708,2816,2837,2968,2990,3024,3030,3159,3166,3269,3330,3403,3427,3501,3502,3766,3792,3967,4043,4134,4210,4232,4256,4263,4376,4420,4430,4490,4597,4646,4679,4803],"values":[2.197419490113369,3.5290927667530343,2.7528077018796004,8.120106597856163,3.968344872438582,5.680854970012496,10.050297000155263,3.200721598977154,1.2009241203572432,2.360821161048281,5.475002915808347,4.682326139901369,3.7639323578304356,3.9529993027639216,4.945743590353519,4.266389731925909,6.444975750918217,3.381131109299483,3.11590561255096,5.093068305110378,3.1562698364063198,6.402989687445694,3.6049912496805447,3.352245132960166,6.29176405233547,24.461057959880055,3.7808819161442084,3.4102029241214598,7.804709020920672,2.76077031479782,3.364085242026494,3.8380403299841572,3.9735128425970245,4.64108318136732,7.816653725424658,2.4064092939894848,3.9180830376576936,3.847131301685409,2.965214599643611,4.148606696269526,2.648653016677114,3.8024810279476706,2.579170936514875,5.709842506885749,8.880824971810338,5.265911117949789,3.0541181247852784,5.6526840930458,1.974275938799159,7.74982173158497,2.5232468308248404,4.407889294199609,6.597145701886651,2.7289253191168985,3.5526232641632287,2.787313637355053,2.931754229079929,4.054419481209825,5.061815761606273,3.098475977415676,4.071417057578396,6.330347274608356,5.919119084320531,8.280731096473213]}}

One is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head. The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great.For the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional.

{"reviewText":"I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX).  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business, trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below, you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one.  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet, and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't.It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it, those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use).  It's very directional and \"selective\" (rejecting room ambience and background noise), so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications.  But for announcing, broadcasting, vocal performance and vocal recording, I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"underscore endorsement mic previous reviewer fox started mic collecting business trying every trendy dynamic condenser mic hundred dollar range might actually save buck cutting directly chase going one always wondered reproduce sound local npr outlet finally realize shure sm b enhances voice depth richness filter pop unwanted percussives face separate pop filter cumbersome use directional selective rejecting room ambience background noise perhaps ideal mic application announcing broadcasting vocal performance vocal recording see anything could possibly equal let alone surpass","words":["underscore","endorsement","mic","previous","reviewer","fox","started","mic","collecting","business","trying","every","trendy","dynamic","condenser","mic","hundred","dollar","range","might","actually","save","buck","cutting","directly","chase","going","one","always","wondered","reproduce","sound","local","npr","outlet","finally","realize","shure","sm","b","enhances","voice","depth","richness","filter","pop","unwanted","percussives","face","separate","pop","filter","cumbersome","use","directional","selective","rejecting","room","ambience","background","noise","perhaps","ideal","mic","application","announcing","broadcasting","vocal","performance","vocal","recording","see","anything","could","possibly","equal","let","alone","surpass"],"filtered_words":["underscore","endorsement","mic","previous","reviewer","fox","started","mic","collecting","business","trying","every","trendy","dynamic","condenser","mic","hundred","dollar","range","might","actually","save","buck","cutting","directly","chase","going","one","always","wondered","reproduce","sound","local","npr","outlet","finally","realize","shure","sm","b","enhances","voice","depth","richness","filter","pop","unwanted","percussives","face","separate","pop","filter","cumbersome","use","directional","selective","rejecting","room","ambience","background","noise","perhaps","ideal","mic","application","announcing","broadcasting","vocal","performance","vocal","recording","see","anything","possibly","equal","let","alone","surpass"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[38,83,133,146,165,175,193,221,228,306,354,373,374,494,601,619,649,730,815,939,975,1166,1188,1259,1346,1447,1491,1532,1582,1585,1591,1714,1817,1965,2054,2099,2114,2167,2282,2490,2492,2789,2986,2993,3052,3267,3303,3318,3382,3530,3708,3718,3773,3831,3846,3860,3924,4011,4034,4165,4320,4351,4481,4485,4520,4609,4659,4681,4706,4756,4822,4898],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[38,83,133,146,165,175,193,221,228,306,354,373,374,494,601,619,649,730,815,939,975,1166,1188,1259,1346,1447,1491,1532,1582,1585,1591,1714,1817,1965,2054,2099,2114,2167,2282,2490,2492,2789,2986,2993,3052,3267,3303,3318,3382,3530,3708,3718,3773,3831,3846,3860,3924,4011,4034,4165,4320,4351,4481,4485,4520,4609,4659,4681,4706,4756,4822,4898],"values":[2.9226549852248147,6.345831273605746,1.3296557991338742,4.361005708300759,3.483630392676277,5.016695326325803,7.290292882446597,5.125329167328599,4.060053298928081,7.926406945876327,2.7244577018571823,10.534460557250293,5.709842506885749,3.3500990000517543,5.344382733391283,3.62307492511384,7.397737528966747,5.0020965269046505,1.1804105805241405,7.849908670382019,5.247218984937636,1.3569115464196395,4.5000045831074145,4.465518407036245,5.386055429791852,3.1770798359201136,4.817362423705312,6.671253674040373,5.15866558759619,5.547323577387973,4.482612840395546,5.093068305110378,4.060053298928081,7.156761489822074,6.8383077587035395,6.402989687445694,3.3281200933329793,3.9180830376576936,5.802215827016764,3.9529993027639216,3.5837138512332594,6.8383077587035395,5.73969547003543,6.29176405233547,3.3363056779194187,3.587228793340704,3.9328981234428344,3.656473205515688,4.136336603677711,4.415921465896873,5.125329167328599,4.879494204812318,4.671854840034074,4.218923194686986,3.100638140420171,6.058149201153965,3.147158156055064,2.8628832419248975,4.841753876829471,3.9229970524601225,2.965214599643611,3.9529993027639216,5.978106493480428,2.9998334412982057,3.9529993027639216,5.452013397583649,7.759233513659796,3.025602954477257,4.082911437004131,3.9378856649538734,7.156761489822074,4.582242681344387]}}

{"reviewText":"I didn't know what to expect given the price, but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money. I am impressed by the quality of materials, components, and construction. For example, the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly, and firmly hold the strings in tune. The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high, but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so, and now the guitar plays even better. I might tinker some more at some point, probably when it comes time to replace the strings, but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought, which is rich and resonant and very impressive. I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price, but the proof is indisputably before me.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"know expect given price happy say nice guitar money impressed quality material component construction example tuning machine substantial heavily chromed work smoothly firmly hold string tune instrument came relatively well set right box action seem inordinately high resist taking little bottom compensated saddle even guitar play even better might tinker point probably come time replace string quite happy playability sound full bodied dreadnought rich resonant impressive still hardly believe possible deliver fine instrument low price proof indisputably","words":["know","expect","given","price","happy","say","nice","guitar","money","impressed","quality","material","component","construction","example","tuning","machine","substantial","heavily","chromed","work","smoothly","firmly","hold","string","tune","instrument","came","relatively","well","set","right","box","action","seem","inordinately","high","resist","taking","little","bottom","compensated","saddle","even","guitar","play","even","better","might","tinker","point","probably","come","time","replace","string","quite","happy","playability","sound","full","bodied","dreadnought","rich","resonant","impressive","still","hardly","believe","possible","deliver","fine","instrument","low","price","proof","indisputably"],"filtered_words":["know","expect","given","price","happy","say","nice","guitar","money","impressed","quality","material","component","construction","example","tuning","machine","substantial","heavily","chromed","work","smoothly","firmly","hold","string","tune","instrument","came","relatively","well","set","right","box","action","seem","inordinately","high","resist","taking","little","bottom","compensated","saddle","even","guitar","play","even","better","might","tinker","point","probably","come","time","replace","string","quite","happy","playability","sound","full","bodied","dreadnought","rich","resonant","impressive","still","hardly","believe","possible","deliver","fine","instrument","low","price","proof","indisputably"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[157,186,187,342,347,370,427,443,515,533,780,815,834,862,961,1056,1096,1100,1103,1166,1206,1212,1224,1404,1406,1409,1431,1590,1633,1738,1776,1790,1964,2116,2148,2173,2297,2368,2389,2543,2545,2588,2779,2882,2922,3040,3157,3228,3231,3323,3370,3411,3506,3567,3657,3691,3712,3873,3897,3924,4058,4086,4193,4275,4416,4502,4527,4606,4803,4897,4953],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[157,186,187,342,347,370,427,443,515,533,780,815,834,862,961,1056,1096,1100,1103,1166,1206,1212,1224,1404,1406,1409,1431,1590,1633,1738,1776,1790,1964,2116,2148,2173,2297,2368,2389,2543,2545,2588,2779,2882,2922,3040,3157,3228,3231,3323,3370,3411,3506,3567,3657,3691,3712,3873,3897,3924,4058,4086,4193,4275,4416,4502,4527,4606,4803,4897,4953],"values":[1.3764038509398002,5.625285118857685,4.671854840034074,2.4711640547213682,6.209953084037539,3.7067739439904868,5.4295405417315905,6.145160578143594,7.156761489822074,3.999761068671961,3.205517771240647,1.1804105805241405,4.854176396828029,2.3589069600044814,5.365002020594019,3.0749957098068337,5.324180026073764,4.535722665709494,2.9172349177554757,1.3569115464196395,3.7723712264763,4.060053298928081,6.058149201153965,3.5978483621681643,4.229901156514737,6.191680593778488,2.6751723656053374,1.653464542587499,4.167298829281679,3.352245132960166,6.058149201153965,2.4150955592454455,2.505184931019827,2.718531758589635,4.474029096704154,2.2349574094324343,3.0645024340909948,2.844285918109308,2.601569673640224,2.0063642533506596,3.364085242026494,3.277778338472128,2.4238579373244313,5.868907201515436,3.0215949330797183,4.368668581046328,1.9044880617754443,4.572763937389843,3.82010262929749,4.591812132360538,1.9506964829791245,2.6780052286896416,1.95688419608729,5.356010457379283,7.62676511906781,3.6640489993241454,2.4194671509069416,5.709842506885749,3.5594492292336284,3.147158156055064,5.4295405417315905,4.005094414647323,3.163158497401505,3.7937853209801164,3.467882035708138,6.1007088155727605,1.3452463153629912,4.93213793829774,2.070182774118303,3.166365235395442,3.6755214004863825]}}

{"reviewText":"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"first used pedal green screemer died friend o hand let use used bos metal zone produced nasal tone liking plug o pleasently impressed range distortion overdrive o pedal produced play fender bassman mix tube pedal produce sweet tone also played pedal solid state amp still impressed spent year searching pedal could produce nice tight churnch warm low bottom end search ended pedal highly recomend pedal rock blue metal country punk guitar player","words":["first","used","pedal","green","screemer","died","friend","o","hand","let","use","used","bos","metal","zone","produced","nasal","tone","liking","plug","o","pleasently","impressed","range","distortion","overdrive","o","pedal","produced","play","fender","bassman","mix","tube","pedal","produce","sweet","tone","also","played","pedal","solid","state","amp","still","impressed","spent","year","searching","pedal","could","produce","nice","tight","churnch","warm","low","bottom","end","search","ended","pedal","highly","recomend","pedal","rock","blue","metal","country","punk","guitar","player"],"filtered_words":["first","used","pedal","green","screemer","died","friend","o","hand","let","use","used","bos","metal","zone","produced","nasal","tone","liking","plug","o","pleasently","impressed","range","distortion","overdrive","o","pedal","produced","play","fender","bassman","mix","tube","pedal","produce","sweet","tone","also","played","pedal","solid","state","amp","still","impressed","spent","year","searching","pedal","produce","nice","tight","churnch","warm","low","bottom","end","search","ended","pedal","highly","recomend","pedal","rock","blue","metal","country","punk","guitar","player"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[133,165,237,345,426,453,488,505,551,574,768,1080,1177,1219,1403,1470,1499,1604,1636,1648,1706,1716,1804,1808,2148,2173,2350,2378,2545,2596,2788,2870,2913,3184,3209,3267,3370,3382,3411,3423,3503,3556,3571,3712,3761,3792,3899,4025,4029,4086,4089,4431,4468,4531,4605,4803,4926],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[133,165,237,345,426,453,488,505,551,574,768,1080,1177,1219,1403,1470,1499,1604,1636,1648,1706,1716,1804,1808,2148,2173,2350,2378,2545,2596,2788,2870,2913,3184,3209,3267,3370,3382,3411,3423,3503,3556,3571,3712,3761,3792,3899,4025,4029,4086,4089,4431,4468,4531,4605,4803,4926],"values":[1.3296557991338742,3.483630392676277,5.835005649839755,6.191680593778488,6.21430564288273,2.6751723656053374,3.6988687644833735,5.284959312920483,4.245770444723174,3.5061032485283357,3.576720815742289,11.47939094007086,5.175760020955491,7.444443562273855,2.494502336849856,3.722774285336928,2.931754229079929,3.1115196406077055,3.404320554218393,8.372694048504746,6.058149201153965,3.2649411917114475,6.058149201153965,4.465518407036245,4.474029096704154,2.2349574094324343,2.655563894216961,4.52344824095373,3.364085242026494,4.71441445445287,3.257317266600788,5.365002020594019,2.3145448473507817,4.106304316578837,3.5942959605637967,3.587228793340704,1.9506964829791245,4.136336603677711,2.6780052286896416,3.2472416146120464,14.424993225143815,17.31140138610655,5.247218984937636,2.4194671509069416,4.563374197040004,1.974275938799159,2.2524130662437756,5.365002020594019,2.751567795866658,8.010188829294647,3.8380403299841572,5.5986168717755245,4.225567737405655,3.630400965205913,3.9248334273140313,1.0350913870591516,2.355818949315905]}}
{"reviewText":"I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks. The product description didn't mention that, but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years. After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks. I wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment.

{"reviewText":"I got the $50 standard black on black case.  The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush! Wow! Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway. Regarding the item itself, I am bit lukewarm. I have a $500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions. And I got that. Its lightweight, plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head.  However, the fit is a bit loose and I don't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time.  So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear, or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane, this case is not the one you want to buy.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"got standard black black case case arrived within day via ups middle christmas rush wow fast shipping adequately packaged sign box abused anyway regarding item bit lukewarm washburn wanted something gig bag going gig practice session got lightweight plenty room gear box top guitar head however fit bit loose sense case stand much abuse time pricey guitar planning load guitar truck gear might ship guitar take plane case one want buy","words":["got","standard","black","black","case","case","arrived","within","day","via","ups","middle","christmas","rush","wow","fast","shipping","adequately","packaged","sign","box","abused","anyway","regarding","item","bit","lukewarm","washburn","wanted","something","gig","bag","going","gig","practice","session","got","lightweight","plenty","room","gear","box","top","guitar","head","however","fit","bit","loose","sense","case","stand","much","abuse","time","pricey","guitar","planning","load","guitar","truck","gear","might","ship","guitar","take","plane","case","one","want","buy"],"filtered_words":["got","standard","black","black","case","case","arrived","within","day","via","ups","middle","christmas","rush","wow","fast","shipping","adequately","packaged","sign","box","abused","anyway","regarding","item","bit","lukewarm","washburn","wanted","something","gig","bag","going","gig","practice","session","got","lightweight","plenty","room","gear","box","top","guitar","head","however","fit","bit","loose","sense","case","stand","much","abuse","time","pricey","guitar","planning","load","guitar","truck","gear","might","ship","guitar","take","plane","case","one","want","buy"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[4,38,39,80,258,328,415,447,494,524,534,542,559,815,855,911,1010,1016,1064,1342,1415,1517,1622,1756,1822,1886,1895,1915,1916,1948,1989,2063,2169,2369,2616,2712,2753,2791,2922,2967,2995,3133,3157,3348,3638,3845,3924,3928,4133,4221,4263,4280,4455,4803,4817,4826,4878,4957,4970],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[4,38,39,80,258,328,415,447,494,524,534,542,559,815,855,911,1010,1016,1064,1342,1415,1517,1622,1756,1822,1886,1895,1915,1916,1948,1989,2063,2169,2369,2616,2712,2753,2791,2922,2967,2995,3133,3157,3348,3638,3845,3924,3928,4133,4221,4263,4280,4455,4803,4817,4826,4878,4957,4970],"values":[6.345831273605746,2.9226549852248147,6.933617938507864,2.197419490113369,5.386055429791852,2.9539362846059034,3.4431894231177664,2.1061045213763325,3.3500990000517543,1.840481422899865,5.19315176366736,6.46957630708152,4.508815212789569,1.1804105805241405,2.6514116391161937,2.9998334412982057,4.7447992800979115,5.940366165497581,3.389764256444186,10.763413484669961,4.866755179034889,4.071417057578396,5.0020965269046505,4.252596409793574,5.247218984937636,2.4461057959880055,8.120106597856163,5.6526840930458,3.5061032485283357,7.445548570673856,4.937719812473036,6.058149201153965,4.6112302182176395,3.7981237225787146,3.333569698100544,2.287305809188598,5.0020965269046505,6.1007088155727605,6.0431898661594365,3.372571855903813,4.112239052098651,3.4220724996768435,1.9044880617754443,2.5075744184172084,4.173607998474943,5.940366165497581,3.147158156055064,5.365002020594019,3.0541181247852784,4.345853903280156,2.787313637355053,3.401392294439305,4.173607998474943,4.140365548236606,4.544855149272767,2.801656512714457,4.879494204812318,6.402989687445694,4.736393361171645]}}

{"reviewText":"I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe.

{"reviewText":"I hadn't played guitar in a number of years and decided to get back into it. Having had carpal tunnel surgery a few months ago, and having small hands to begin with, I started researching guitars with narrow necks. The Jasmine by Takamine kept coming up and had really good reviews, so I decided to give it a try, buying the S34C. Firstly, it was delivered promptly as requested, and arrived in pristine condition, with some really nice strings. It has a lovely honey gold finish on the front of the body, which had attracted me to the guitar in the first place. I really appreciate the cutaway. How many high notes will I be hitting on this baby? Who knows, but it looks WAY cool, LOL! The craftsmanship, at least to my unpracticed eyes, looks superb. I wasn't too crazy about the pickguard with all the lettering on it, but finally figured out the lettering was just a sticker that could be easily removed. And the sound...just lovely, with that ringing tonality one would expect from a steel string guitar, but with some lovely mellow tones where needed as well. I am so jazzed about how wonderful this guitar is, I'm taking online video lessons and learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques! Hey, I don't expect to be a Leo Kottke or Martin Simpson anytime soon, but I've got something to shoot for, and we all need a dream! If you're looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price, look no further. Oh, the reason why I only gave it four stars is cuz the neck really doesn't seem to be all that narrow after all. But, maybe it's just my small kid-like hands. Thumb to little finger, I can barely reach an octave on piano.

{"reviewText":"I have K&K pickups in other guitars.  This is the first one I've bought that had the smaller transducers.  It needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued Pure Western with the larger transducers.  Like other K&K pickups it sounds darned good.  With a decent PA head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking.  The pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack.  This one comes with an ingenious DIY installation jig made from, I'm not kidding, cardboard, golf tees, and double sided tape.  It makes placement a snap.

{"reviewText":"I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed \"off\"  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box).","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"playing year tak jasmine acoustic jay turser strat knockoff really love le paul sound pocket book large enough le paul price read everything epi finally

{"reviewText":"I honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. First, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. And as for the winder... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. Didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. Just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it, I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set(the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, I'll try the notch bridge peg puller.

The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"know know many people hate pedal calling stale generic problem simply found right setting pedal amp setting amp pedal make difference one thing note bit quiet side opinion digitech bad monkey set level match amp pedal crank level make clean tone level distorted tone","words":["know","know","many","people","hate","pedal","calling","stale","generic","problem","simply","found","right","setting","pedal","amp","setting","amp","pedal","make","difference","one","thing","note","bit","quiet","side","opinion","digitech","bad","monkey","set","level","match","amp","pedal","crank","level","make","clean","tone","level","distorted","tone"],"filtered_words":["know","know","many","people","hate","pedal","calling","stale","generic","problem","simply","found","right","setting","pedal","amp","setting","amp","pedal","make","difference","one","thing","note","bit","quiet","side","opinion","digitech","bad","monkey","set","level","match","amp","pedal","crank","level","make","clean","tone","level","distorted","tone"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[188,313,342,457,697,815,936,1061,1499,1642,1698,1781,1790,1866,1934,1989,2069,2378,2571,2779,2866,2956,3129,3503,3525,3793,3857,4016,4263,4781,4909,4926,4935],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[188,313,342,457,697,815,936,1061,1499,1642,1698,1781,1790,1866,1934,1989,2069,2378,2571,2779,2866,2956,3129,3503,3525,3793,3857,4016,4263,4781,4909,4926,4935],"values":[2.751567795866658,6.8204058482429195,2.4711640547213682,6.29176405233547,4.384172767582293,1.1804105805241405,5.903998521326706,2.9262847532753935,8.795262687239788,3.499630734022718,2.5354719219540995,3.833525649629631,2.4150955592454455,5.6526840930458,3.889095500784441,2.468859906236518,4.671854840034074,4.52344824095373,5.046548289475485,4.847715874648863,3.1028049885052615,3.1426332614567745,5.19315176366736,8.242853271510752,3.949955879059978,4.316222105673785,2.152815183876615,3.015612861402171,2.787313637355053,2.0831513965644297,3.333569698100544,7.067456847947716,3.5191753300956883]}}

I'm using the 9v battery adaptor for the wah and my Dist+, and I get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah (not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain) and intermittant operating problems with the Dist+.  I get a slightly louder hum from the Fulltone pedals when they're on, but my newer Boss/Ibanez/MXR pedals have no issues at all.  The One Spot is not a regulated power supply (if it was, they'd say so), so maybe that's the culprit; not sure.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"like getting rid extra adaptor special power strip work well ibanez mxr bos pedal outside adaptor socket seem work well vox wah old mxr distortion plus fulltone pedal using v battery adaptor wah dist get really weird random squealy noise wah one get wah playing well another pedal chain intermittant operating problem dist get slightly louder hum fulltone pedal newer bos ibanez mxr pedal issue one spot regulated power supply say maybe culprit sure","words":["like","getting","rid","extra","adaptor","special","power","strip","work","well","ibanez","mxr","bos","pedal","outside","adaptor","socket","seem","work","well","vox","wah","old","mxr","distortion","plus","fulltone","pedal","using","v","battery","adaptor","wah","dist","get","really","weird","random","squealy","noise","wah","one","get","wah","playing","well","another","pedal","chain","intermittant","operating","problem","dist","get","slightly","louder","hum","fulltone","pedal","newer","bos","ibanez","mxr","pedal","issue","one","spot","regulated","power","supply","say","maybe","culprit","sure"],"filtered_words":["like","getting","rid","extra","adaptor","special","power","strip","work","well","ibanez","mxr","bos","pedal","outside","adaptor","socket","seem","work","well","vox","wah","old","mxr","distortion","plus","fulltone","pedal","using","v","battery","adaptor","wah","dist","get","really","weird","random","squealy","noise","wah","one","get","wah","playing","well","another","pedal","chain","intermittant","operating","problem","dist","get","slightly","louder","hum","fulltone","pedal","newer","bos","ibanez","mxr","pedal","issue","one","spot","regulated","power","supply","say","maybe","culprit","sure"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[1,157,321,815,862,960,1055,1351,1456,1494,1544,1616,1698,1716,1779,1821,1860,1897,2083,2101,2106,2251,2300,2524,2540,2588,2743,2848,2889,3010,3056,3083,3166,3300,3330,3503,3568,3635,3846,3981,4080,4094,4112,4349,4354,4426,4527,4531,4574,4781,4818,4859],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[1,157,321,815,862,960,1055,1351,1456,1494,1544,1616,1698,1716,1779,1821,1860,1897,2083,2101,2106,2251,2300,2524,2540,2588,2743,2848,2889,3010,3056,3083,3166,3300,3330,3503,3568,3635,3846,3981,4080,4094,4112,4349,4354,4426,4527,4531,4574,4781,4818,4859],"values":[3.5978483621681643,4.129211552819401,4.6112302182176395,2.360821161048281,2.3589069600044814,2.164629667290378,4.192777914582663,4.032196344425115,5.572641385372264,3.11590561255096,5.770467128702183,3.1562698364063198,2.5354719219540995,3.2649411917114475,14.88888712454771,2.7638567370010096,3.6793749698023723,3.7808819161442084,3.0898737738330126,7.444443562273855,6.345831273605746,5.016695326325803,4.376390627140238,3.7981237225787146,3.163158497401505,3.277778338472128,6.933617938507864,5.522630964797602,3.3173091772287635,15.279204915331132,6.149991419613667,5.093068305110378,2.648653016677114,4.015847206423585,1.2895854682574375,10.30356658938844,4.781855735248402,2.8594760836032833,3.100638140420171,17.96508361255464,12.383361187556975,12.841127921701947,1.786705026119061,5.452013397583649,9.495133323539541,4.6446175953266815,2.6904926307259824,7.260801930411826,4.879494204812318,2.0831513965644297,3.576720815742289,3.908326862712329]}}

{"reviewText":"I only use this as a tube amp for vocal.  For the price, I can drive 2 mics, and fit it in a 1U space.  The tube sound is good enough for live performance for as long as I don't crank it up too much, it also helps with the gain of the SM58 as it's much lower than my other Line6 mic.  I used to have multiple  Studio Projects VTB-1s and ART Tube Pacs but their tubes seem to have died due to old age, and I mainly cared for the tube feature in them, so stepping down to the MIC2200 is fine with me.If you want to get warmer vocal sound, and don't want to invest too much for it, the MIC2200 is the way to go, imo.  However, buying Behringer products always require crossing fingers (and hope that they last).

{"reviewText":"I picked these up on impulse &#8211; they were on a good sale and I was dissatisfied with my older, cheaper set of Panasonic over-the-ears.  I'm glad I did &#8211; these are excellent headphones and they've exceeded my expectations on just about every level.  The sound quality is exceptional and they do a very solid job of blocking external noise.  They feel extremely sturdy and well-made, from the cans themselves to the nice, thick coiled cord (although a removable cord would be a nice bonus).  Finally, and this is important, they're incredibly comfortable.  As a video editor, I often wind up wearing headphones for hours at a time.  The cans rotate on two axis, so they conform to the shape of your head and the headband is thick and well-padded.  They grip your head snugly, without that horrible &#34;vice grip&#34; feeling.I've heard several reviewers say that these are the best headphones to be found for under $200.  I haven't tried enough pairs to make that judgement, but I will say that I highly recommend them.

{"reviewText":"I purchased a Classical guitar and only had a traditional (steel string) Capo available to me. Not thinking it through I used it on my Nylon Stings and after a few times I realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced. Along with my string order I added this Capo so it does not happen again.Pros:It's small and lightweight.It's very well made. It not  only looks great but also appear to be of high quality.It's very adjustable. Unlike my steel string Capo, this uses a screw/knob to tighten, not spring loaded. This allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings.It works on steel strings. Yep, I found my self needing a Capo on another guitar and only having this with me, I saw no reason it should not work so I gave it a try and it performed wonderfully. I won't be using it full time on my steel strings, but great to know in a pinch I have use it.If you need a great capo thats gentle on your Nylon strings then this is the one to get.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"purchased classical guitar traditional steel string capo available thinking used nylon sting time realized damaged string point replaced along string order added capo happen pro small lightweight well made look great also appear high quality adjustable unlike steel string capo us screw knob tighten spring loaded allows finely tune capo add enough pressure bar fret damage sting work steel string yep found self needing capo another guitar saw reason work gave try performed wonderfully using full time steel string great know pinch use need great capo thats gentle nylon string one get","words":["purchased","classical","guitar","traditional","steel","string","capo","available","thinking","used","nylon","sting","time","realized","damaged","string","point","replaced","along","string","order","added","capo","happen","pro","small","lightweight","well","made","look","great","also","appear","high","quality","adjustable","unlike","steel","string","capo","us","screw","knob","tighten","spring","loaded","allows","finely","tune","capo","add","enough","pressure","bar","fret","damage","sting","work","steel","string","yep","found","self","needing","capo","another","guitar","saw","reason","work","gave","try","performed","wonderfully","using","full","time","steel","string","great","know","pinch","use","need","great","capo","thats","gentle","nylon","string","one","get"],"filtered_words":["purchased","classical","guitar","traditional","steel","string","capo","available","thinking","used","nylon","sting","time","realized","damaged","string","point","replaced","along","string","order","added","capo","happen","pro","small","lightweight","well","made","look","great","also","appear","high","quality","adjustable","unlike","steel","string","capo","us","screw","knob","tighten","spring","loaded","allows","finely","tune","capo","add","enough","pressure","bar","fret","damage","sting","work","steel","string","yep","found","self","needing","capo","another","guitar","saw","reason","work","gave","try","performed","wonderfully","using","full","time","steel","string","great","know","pinch","use","need","great","capo","thats","gentle","nylon","string","one","get"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[20,47,73,133,157,222,278,402,661,696,750,775,815,816,960,1061,1198,1226,1415,1537,1644,1660,1981,2116,2332,2368,2380,2475,2478,2500,2769,2779,2833,2840,2847,2944,3157,3162,3166,3182,3340,3344,3365,3506,3554,3624,3792,3897,3946,3975,3998,4195,4216,4240,4257,4258,4416,4426,4439,4486,4527,4597,4605,4693,4704,4748,4803,4887,4897,4939,4987],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[20,47,73,133,157,222,278,402,661,696,750,775,815,816,960,1061,1198,1226,1415,1537,1644,1660,1981,2116,2332,2368,2380,2475,2478,2500,2769,2779,2833,2840,2847,2944,3157,3162,3166,3182,3340,3344,3365,3506,3554,3624,3792,3897,3946,3975,3998,4195,4216,4240,4257,4258,4416,4426,4439,4486,4527,4597,4605,4693,4704,4748,4803,4887,4897,4939,4987],"values":[4.218923194686986,4.308949346344705,5.709842506885749,1.3296557991338742,1.3764038509398002,2.575627881662224,8.560751947801299,3.237266469555227,4.682326139901369,2.6709380614665488,3.6027723610717297,3.851707968712821,1.1804105805241405,6.751296381713909,2.164629667290378,2.9262847532753935,3.23478815354076,3.4804608179149983,4.866755179034889,1.9792003244098373,4.148606696269526,4.112239052098651,20.44354448335022,2.718531758589635,4.440412485905169,2.844285918109308,4.892397609648226,4.323548145765858,2.76077031479782,16.49686097258147,4.415921465896873,2.4238579373244313,3.333569698100544,3.8702270164800585,5.802215827016764,3.6452160509910536,3.8089761235508885,5.15866558759619,2.648653016677114,5.324180026073764,5.6526840930458,2.2598549610541614,3.0417976403972378,1.95688419608729,9.610772465317194,5.304377398777584,1.974275938799159,3.5594492292336284,4.482612840395546,4.173607998474943,4.037706000236084,6.751296381713909,5.14185846927981,3.7723712264763,4.736393361171645,5.365002020594019,3.467882035708138,1.548205865108894,5.407561635012815,4.973523154460595,2.6904926307259824,4.071417057578396,1.9624167136570156,2.695173032312007,3.7597394795703996,2.5317886765378033,2.070182774118303,3.3119472340873783,11.082278323884047,2.2959805623822716,4.399921124550432]}}

{"reviewText":"I purchased this for my love of playing guitar. I like blues style and classic rock. This 25 watt amp will get the job done. It is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means. After a few months of playing the bass knob just blew. So I had no bass control. Arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging. You just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want. Took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings.This amp is rated 75 watts, so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a 50 watt (into 8 ohm). I would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or Jensen. I'd recommend it, but don't buy it if your looking for a really decent tone.

{"reviewText":"I put this in a $200 guitar.  I have a Recording King (RD-06) that sounds so good, that I wanted to use it for live gigs.  So I popped in this K&K.  I ran it through my SWR California Blonde II acoustic amp.  If you have been wanting an acoustic guitar to have that &#34;miked&#34; when you plug it in, this is as close as it gets!  I recommend getting a sound-hole cover if you play with a band, but you will not be disappointed.  The installation can be a little tricky, but with a little patience and reading, anybody can install it.  If you don't feel comfortable, just go pay a local luthier to install it for $30, or ask your grandmother for help :P","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"put guitar recording king rd sound good wanted use live gig popped k k ran swr california blonde ii acoustic amp wanting acoustic guitar miked plug close get recommend getting sound hole cover play band disappointed installation little tricky little patience reading anybody install feel comfortable go pay local luthier install ask grandmother help p","words":["put","guitar","recording","king","rd","sound","good","wanted","use","live","gig","popped","k","k","ran","swr","california","blonde","ii","acoustic","amp","wanting","acoustic","guitar","miked","plug","close","get","recommend","getting","sound","hole","cover","play","band","disappointed","installation","little","tricky","little","patience","reading","anybody","install","feel","comfortable","go","pay","local","luthier","install","ask","grandmother","help","p"],"filtered_words":["put","guitar","recording","king","rd","sound","good","wanted","use","live","gig","popped","k","k","ran","swr","california","blonde","ii","acoustic","amp","wanting","acoustic","guitar","miked","plug","close","get","recommend","getting","sound","hole","cover","play","band","disappointed","installation","little","tricky","little","patience","reading","anybody","install","feel","comfortable","go","pay","local","luthier","install","ask","grandmother","help","p"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[85,121,133,228,413,493,542,628,662,704,983,1104,1166,1168,1369,1451,1541,1590,1740,1772,2129,2173,2363,2540,2616,2630,2788,2968,3115,3494,3497,3507,3598,3696,3815,3871,4049,4116,4347,4361,4426,4485,4526,4667,4775,4803,4864,4897,4926],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[85,121,133,228,413,493,542,628,662,704,983,1104,1166,1168,1369,1451,1541,1590,1740,1772,2129,2173,2363,2540,2616,2630,2788,2968,3115,3494,3497,3507,3598,3696,3815,3871,4049,4116,4347,4361,4426,4485,4526,4667,4775,4803,4864,4897,4926],"values":[4.9187149179656,7.444443562273855,1.3296557991338742,4.060053298928081,4.945743590353519,3.637781072503535,3.23478815354076,4.770294912847326,3.5978483621681643,5.73969547003543,5.6526840930458,4.205765110109475,2.713823092839279,1.3002579281482092,5.452013397583649,2.21422660842975,10.648360052147527,3.306929085174998,4.9187149179656,5.770467128702183,4.49127090313866,2.2349574094324343,6.058149201153965,3.163158497401505,3.333569698100544,4.112239052098651,3.257317266600788,4.8128185879789696,2.459696039129727,5.344382733391283,3.6640489993241454,4.212322510655634,4.273358401242003,4.167298829281679,7.62676511906781,2.5075744184172084,3.6755214004863825,2.4551454055657307,2.935417236838666,4.631032845513819,1.548205865108894,2.9998334412982057,4.218923194686986,7.936689744877164,5.365002020594019,2.070182774118303,3.5978483621681643,1.583182617697721,2.355818949315905]}}

{"reviewText":"I really like these strings, because I have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast. I can play a guitar once, and leave it there for 2-3 weeks, and the strings will be rusty and nasty when I return to it. I now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them, but this stil happens.Then I happened across these Elixir nanowebs. They are great. I no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly, and they stay rust and gunk-free for 2+ weeks (of regular playing). However, I did encounter one strange thing. While playing at a rehearsal, my E-string just popped and broke, hurting my finger a bit. I was surprised, because outwardly the string didn't look that bad.So that is the downside. With regular strings, you can tell the string is near the end of its life b/c it looks really bad. With these, they may still look okay but be close to breaking. Made me a little cautious.I still prefer these 100% over other strings, though.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"really like string sweaty hand tend make string guitar corrode rust fast play guitar leave week string rusty nasty return rub string thoroughly session playing stil happens happened across elixir nanowebs great longer need rub string thoroughly stay rust gunk free week regular playing however encounter one strange thing playing rehearsal e string popped broke hurting finger bit surprised outwardly string look bad downside regular string tell string near end life b c look really bad may still look okay close breaking made little cautious still prefer string though","words":["really","like","string","sweaty","hand","tend","make","string","guitar","corrode","rust","fast","play","guitar","leave","week","string","rusty","nasty","return","rub","string","thoroughly","session","playing","stil","happens","happened","across","elixir","nanowebs","great","longer","need","rub","string","thoroughly","stay","rust","gunk","free","week","regular","playing","however","encounter","one","strange","thing","playing","rehearsal","e","string","popped","broke","hurting","finger","bit","surprised","outwardly","string","look","bad","downside","regular","string","tell","string","near","end","life","b","c","look","really","bad","may","still","look","okay","close","breaking","made","little","cautious","still","prefer","string","though"],"filtered_words":["really","like","string","sweaty","hand","tend","make","string","guitar","corrode","rust","fast","play","guitar","leave","week","string","rusty","nasty","return","rub","string","thoroughly","session","playing","stil","happens","happened","across","elixir","nanowebs","great","longer","need","rub","string","thoroughly","stay","rust","gunk","free","week","regular","playing","however","encounter","one","strange","thing","playing","rehearsal","e","string","popped","broke","hurting","finger","bit","surprised","outwardly","string","look","bad","downside","regular","string","tell","string","near","end","life","b","c","look","really","bad","may","still","look","okay","close","breaking","made","little","cautious","still","prefer","string","though"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[96,122,314,397,433,453,494,635,715,750,815,911,974,1069,1073,1398,1537,1590,1649,1772,1810,1850,1875,1989,2074,2173,2200,2211,2234,2327,2576,2775,2913,2956,3294,3330,3344,3385,3423,3458,3477,3497,3515,3525,3546,3550,3638,3689,3712,3768,3857,4017,4084,4105,4112,4122,4160,4165,4263,4663,4779,4781,4803,4859,4897,4939],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,10.0,3.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[96,122,314,397,433,453,494,635,715,750,815,911,974,1069,1073,1398,1537,1590,1649,1772,1810,1850,1875,1989,2074,2173,2200,2211,2234,2327,2576,2775,2913,2956,3294,3330,3344,3385,3423,3458,3477,3497,3515,3525,3546,3550,3638,3689,3712,3768,3857,4017,4084,4105,4112,4122,4160,4165,4263,4663,4779,4781,4803,4859,4897,4939],"values":[4.703603538348654,7.058185533506069,7.038978454165691,6.671253674040373,3.2497510262174725,2.6751723656053374,3.3500990000517543,4.692908249231906,6.4636143092621285,1.2009241203572432,1.1804105805241405,2.9998334412982057,3.7723712264763,3.608581917811273,3.8843448980258435,4.308949346344705,1.9792003244098373,1.653464542587499,3.833525649629631,5.770467128702183,4.692908249231906,3.3754168080360443,8.010188829294647,2.468859906236518,4.13025755760133,2.2349574094324343,7.444443562273855,3.437110377041384,5.770467128702183,5.046548289475485,3.3013088358823226,6.191680593778488,2.3145448473507817,6.285266522913549,11.956212986960857,1.2895854682574375,4.519709922108323,2.822744074334553,3.2472416146120464,5.077319948142239,3.7639323578304356,3.6640489993241454,6.933617938507864,1.974977939529989,4.582242681344387,3.6014134283326604,4.173607998474943,5.835005649839755,4.838934301813883,4.3534011089155396,2.152815183876615,10.81512327002563,5.903998521326706,4.973523154460595,3.573410052238122,6.933617938507864,2.9244682223489957,3.9229970524601225,2.787313637355053,9.91907382497171,6.8383077587035395,6.249454189693289,2.070182774118303,3.908326862712329,15.831826176977211,6.887941687146815]}}

I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick.

On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball.","overall":2.0,"label":0,"clean_text":"tried dean markley blue steel light accoustic string takamine guitar soon replace quality control high e steel string set look bad dark spot two show stringing guitar string break rather expected look bad sound seemed okay first still find hard keep tune week especially high b e steel string sound good find low e wound string note tend high move neck set used guess go back addario ernie ball","words":["tried","dean","markley","blue","steel","light","accoustic","string","takamine","guitar","soon","replace","quality","control","high","e","steel","string","set","look","bad","dark","spot","two","show","stringing","guitar","string","break","rather","expected","look","bad","sound","seemed","okay","first","still","find","hard","keep","tune","week","especially","high","b","e","steel","string","sound","good","find","low","e","wound","string","note","tend","high","move","neck","set","used","guess","go","back","addario","ernie","ball"],"filtered_words":["tried","dean","markley","blue","steel","light","accoustic","string","takamine","guitar","soon","replace","quality","control","high","e","steel","string","set","look","bad","dark","spot","two","show","stringing","guitar","string","break","rather","expected","look","bad","sound","seemed","okay","first","still","find","hard","keep","tune","week","especially","high","b","e","steel","string","sound","good","find","low","e","wound","string","note","tend","high","move","neck","set","used","guess","go","back","addario","ernie","ball"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[122,125,150,342,370,406,618,668,697,768,1041,1085,1166,1168,1208,1282,1403,1451,1720,1810,2116,2271,2368,2492,2500,2510,2837,2946,2956,3173,3300,3411,3430,3502,3506,3546,3550,3606,3660,3712,3993,4019,4165,4460,4594,4605,4728,4755,4792,4803,4897,4909,4939],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[122,125,150,342,370,406,618,668,697,768,1041,1085,1166,1168,1208,1282,1403,1451,1720,1810,2116,2271,2368,2492,2500,2510,2837,2946,2956,3173,3300,3411,3430,3502,3506,3546,3550,3606,3660,3712,3993,4019,4165,4460,4594,4605,4728,4755,4792,4803,4897,4909,4939],"values":[3.5290927667530343,2.876629162829533,2.9064821259792137,4.9423281094427365,3.7067739439904868,4.736393361171645,4.245770444723174,3.4310680625854215,4.384172767582293,3.576720815742289,4.338363231550999,3.7894656598356002,2.713823092839279,1.3002579281482092,3.227389846059315,3.9529993027639216,2.494502336849856,2.21422660842975,2.854387014095812,4.692908249231906,8.155595275768906,6.402989687445694,2.844285918109308,3.5837138512332594,12.372645729436101,5.472831981692112,3.908326862712329,4.482612840395546,6.285266522913549,3.1269554487375446,4.015847206423585,2.6780052286896416,2.48510156256515,3.0541181247852784,1.95688419608729,4.582242681344387,10.80424028499798,5.572641385372264,3.8843448980258435,2.4194671509069416,5.680854970012496,4.026716878660489,3.9229970524601225,4.415921465896873,2.6174640479846905,1.9624167136570156,2.5342426654993697,5.498533413218542,3.7937853209801164,2.070182774118303,7.9159130884886055,3.333569698100544,4.591961124764543]}}
{"reviewText":"I tried this model a few years ago, and I never had a problem with them (once I got it installed), but I went back to the Schallers I had on my other instruments.  I thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which I thought looked goofy.  I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  As I said, I had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great.  As with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"tried model year ago never problem got installed went back schallers instrument thought mentioned others make strap stick far instrument thought looked goofy also particularly care push button release getting locking part end thick strap challenge c clamp nut allowance differing thickness also felt safer schallers hook onto end guitar strap button depend spring loaded button keep part together said real problem look like work great replacement strap lock button make sure screw secure button hole start jumping drum riser dropped airplane","words":["tried","model","year","ago","never","problem","got","installed","went","back","schallers","instrument","thought","mentioned","others","make","strap","stick","far","instrument","thought","looked","goofy","also","particularly","care","push","button","release","getting","locking","part","end","thick","strap","challenge","c","clamp","nut","allowance","differing","thickness","also","felt","safer","schallers","hook","onto","end","guitar","strap","button","depend","spring","loaded","button","keep","part","together","said","real","problem","look","like","work","great","replacement","strap","lock","button","make","sure","screw","secure","button","hole","start","jumping","drum","riser","dropped","airplane"],"filtered_words":["tried","model","year","ago","never","problem","got","installed","went","back","schallers","instrument","thought","mentioned","others","make","strap","stick","far","instrument","thought","looked","goofy","also","particularly","care","push","button","release","getting","locking","part","end","thick","strap","challenge","c","clamp","nut","allowance","differing","thickness","also","felt","safer","schallers","hook","onto","end","guitar","strap","button","depend","spring","loaded","button","keep","part","together","said","real","problem","look","like","work","great","replacement","strap","lock","button","make","sure","screw","secure","button","hole","start","jumping","drum","riser","dropped","airplane"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[55,86,97,120,150,281,310,428,453,750,835,883,935,978,1010,1443,1470,1491,1644,1698,1728,1821,1896,1923,1940,2102,2457,2540,2545,2569,2833,2888,2904,2921,2996,3030,3312,3330,3351,3430,3525,3538,3567,3733,3740,3768,3792,3810,3899,3952,4158,4216,4293,4303,4319,4320,4371,4527,4594,4602,4673,4689,4691,4803,4851,4864,4939],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[55,86,97,120,150,281,310,428,453,750,835,883,935,978,1010,1443,1470,1491,1644,1698,1728,1821,1896,1923,1940,2102,2457,2540,2545,2569,2833,2888,2904,2921,2996,3030,3312,3330,3351,3430,3525,3538,3567,3733,3740,3768,3792,3810,3899,3952,4158,4216,4293,4303,4319,4320,4371,4527,4594,4602,4673,4689,4691,4803,4851,4864,4939],"values":[6.349492225147786,4.781855735248402,4.526672830189576,13.194291403773303,2.9064821259792137,2.822744074334553,4.048817225661155,4.9187149179656,5.350344731210675,1.2009241203572432,3.958088372271393,6.671253674040373,5.835005649839755,4.186347024252373,2.3723996400489558,5.031510412110944,3.722774285336928,4.817362423705312,4.148606696269526,5.070943843908199,18.226080254955267,2.7638567370010096,3.7808819161442084,4.136336603677711,3.407257413891703,3.5802112206820573,4.021267273892924,3.163158497401505,3.364085242026494,3.003755014951387,3.333569698100544,7.038978454165691,4.517704160206816,3.9944560164422676,3.8609246238177453,2.965214599643611,4.015847206423585,1.2895854682574375,10.550776011549578,2.48510156256515,3.949955879059978,4.399921124550432,5.356010457379283,6.933617938507864,6.602617671764645,4.3534011089155396,3.948551877598318,4.308949346344705,2.2524130662437756,6.933617938507864,2.7623123351496353,5.14185846927981,4.6112302182176395,4.245770444723174,3.158560788152876,2.965214599643611,3.82455697964687,1.3452463153629912,2.6174640479846905,6.402989687445694,4.266389731925909,4.544855149272767,3.5594492292336284,1.0350913870591516,5.868907201515436,3.5978483621681643,2.2959805623822716]}}

{"reviewText":"I use this to patch in four ports from aBBE DI-400 4 Channel Active Direct Box Direct Injection DI Boxand two from anAlesis Mic Tube Duo Stereo Tube Microphone Preamplifierinto a mixer. First, the size is perfect in my rack configuration. The cables easily reach, and the color coding makes it a snap to see at a glance what is connected to what. That is a great improvement over tags and labels that require you to get close to read.What makes these a bargain is construction. The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. However, it's the attention to small construction details that I love. The XLR ends are quality components, but cheap, ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down. And unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly. Another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.Overall each cable in this set is constructed to withstand frequent set-up and teardown, and is built to last. If you are shopping for patch cables in this size these are a great value in my opinion because you will probably not have to replace them for years.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"use patch

{"reviewText":"I use this with fairly light mics (seeNady DMK-5 Drum Mic Packagefor details).While I generally do not mic bass drums, when I do this stand allows me to do it my way, which may seem unconventional to some folks. I place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back. Since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne (and hi-hat) hindering access, the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help.Where the stand shines if micing amps. Some small amps, such as theFender Champion 600 Electric Guitar Amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor. This stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height. For larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands, this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it.My use is relatively narrow - kick drums and amps.

{"reviewText":"I usually play classical (nylon string) guitar, but have an Ovation deep-bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out, I never have found strings that I really liked (don't ask me why I never thought about contacting Ovation and asking them what they use from the factory.  One of those duh things I didn't even think of until just now).Based on reviews and questions answered here on Amazon, I purchased this triple-set of strings.  Instant gratification.  First, they tuned up quickly and retained their tune on a relatively respectable basis (no new string holds tune perfectly for the first couple of days, but these retained tune fairly well).  The sound is excellent, the playability comfy.  The tone of my Ovation was back.Here are my itemized observations:* First, three sets for $13 (currently).  Cannot beat the value for price.* BRILLIANCE.  What many people call &#34;bright&#34;, brilliance is the opposite of &#34;dull&#34;.  Some strings sound dull right out of the package.  These strings are brilliant, bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar.* TONE.  The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through, no hint of &#34;tinniness&#34;, &#34;plunk&#34; or &#34;twang&#34;.* MELLOW.  Mellow is difficult to define, but the best definition I've heard is, &#34;Ah, that sounds nice.&#34;  Mellow is a string settling into a guitar and becoming part of the guitar.  It's a pleasantness that doesn't grate on your ears when you pluck a string.  These strings are medium-mellow, just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep.  : )* BALANCE.  At first the E overtoned the b and e.  But as the strings settled that became less pronounced and the strings balanced right out.  The trebles became clearly audible while the E and A provided just the right touch of bass.* COMFORT.  The 12-53mm diameter of these strings is comfortable to the fingers.  Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars.  Lighter gauge tends to cut into the fingers unless the guitar has excellent action.  These strings are just right-- especially the 53mm E, which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming.SUMMARY:  These are excellent strings, which doesn't surprise me since I've use D'Addario classical guitar strings for years.  Martin and GHS are both good strings, but somehow D'Addario just shines.Thanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"usually play classical nylon string guitar ovation deep bowl acoustic electric well original string wore never found string really liked ask

{"reviewText":"I wanted a 12 string, but did not want to spend a lot of money, this guitar fits the bill. The finish is much darker then the pictures online show. GREAT SOUND from this bad boy. This is a BIG GUITAR, once I figured out how to tune the 12 string, it really DOES NOT GO OUT OF TUNE.. After I few hours of play, I retune it and its marginally out of tune, I thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality, while they are not grover tuners, they get it done.The downside for me is, not the guitar's fault.. this is an inexpensive guitar and a FANTASTIC entry into 12 string playing, this Guitar is hard to play below the 15th fret as there is no cut away, but that is true of all guitars using this body type. Now that I have had it awhile I would love for it to be acoustic/electric but again.. for the price, I was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action.

{"reviewText":"I was unsatisfied with the tone from either of my two used solid-state amps, so I ordered a VHT Special Six (supposed to be THE best small tube amp for blues harp), I also ordered a Peavey KB2 (solid state keyboard amp).  Then I ordered this pedal and three others (graphic equalizer; MXR carbon copy delay; T-REX reverb)  I figured that I would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo.  Well everything is being returned except this pedal.  I found that when I plug this pedal into my old 8 watt Peavey Rage, I get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals.  More \"tube-like\" sound than a top-rated tube amp! AND...if I want a cleaner tone, I can dial it back, or bypass it altogether.  My only complaint is that it does not accept a battery.  You must use a 9V transformer, which is not included.  Oh well, my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway. Yes, it is made of plastic, but if you are reasonably careful, that should not be a problem.  UPDATE: I just found that by plugging into BOTH the high and low jacks (at the same time) on the VHT amp, it now produces \"the sound\".  I will keep the VHT and use it instead of my Peavey Rage with this pedal.  The sound from either set-up is pretty close, but the VHT requires less fooling around with adjustments, and is more resistant to feedback. I still might keep this pedal though, cause it's easily the next best thing to the VHT Special 6 tube amp.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"unsatisfied tone either two used solid state amp

{"reviewText":"I'll try to review the strings and not the instrument but that's kinda hard for me to do. I've been playing guitar since my Dad bought me a $7.00, unknown acoustic 46 years ago. That should make me about 58. He put some brand new humpty duty Black Diamond strings on it which pulled the neck up to where the strings sat around 6\" off the fretboard. Well, they weren't very close anyway. The neck had no way to adjust it so imagine learning to play using heavy gauge Black Diamond strings a ways from the fretboard. I didn't know any better so I thought it was normal for the blood dripping off my bent crooked fingertips.Since then I've been through a multitude of guitars and strings. I always wanted a Les Paul but my playing never improved enough to justify $2000.00 - $4000.00. I started reading reviews on the Epiphone Les Paul 100 for $249.00 and they were running from 4.5 - 5 stars. I finally, after much self convincing, bought the ebony through Amazon. I've owned Strats, Telecasters, cheapies, an Alvarez I think. I unpacked it out of the box, did a little tuning and this is absolutely, the most beautiful, sweetest thing I've ever held in my life, (except for the little lady of course). No kidding, I recommend this guitar to anyone even if it cost a couple of grand.Strings: The ones that came on there sounded great. I didn't put it down for a couple of weeks. Sounds great in the bathroom, good acoustics. I finally got the best out of that set of strings. I always use Ernie Ball on everything. They've got a wrench to fit every nut in the house. I saw some Hybrids on Amazon and had never heard of them. I bought a pack of them along with some Super Slinkys, Regular Slinkys, Earthwood Silk & Steels. I put the Hybrids on the new Les Paul. They made it sound even better than it was. Chuck Barry, The Ventures, Clapton, set the LP and Fender amp right and the sound is just as good. The lower strings have a wonderful rich tone, they're fairly heavy but easy on the fingers. The high strings will talk to you. I can bend the g-string easier than a Super Slinky. This is the only guitar I've used them on but they sound great. I imagine I'll stick with them for this machine from now on.

{"reviewText":"I'm a guitarist with a passion for blues, so it was only a matter of time before I was going to pick up the harmonica.  I almost went with some of the cheaper options, but I am extremely pleased with my decision.  It sounds gorgeous (very full and clear), and I've already been able to start bending some notes--which I understand I notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas.As a blues guitarist I was tempted to buy a harmonica in D or A that, when played in second-position, would allow me to play along with blues songs in A or E (two of the most common blues keys; especially among the songs I like to play).  The second-position for the harp in C is G (not terribly common).  However, I think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in C, since many of the beginner songs are in C, and the C major scale should be very familiar to most musicians.  In other words, as I'm exploring the notes, they make a lot of sense to me.  At this price, I won't mind buying a D or A when the time comes--it's not like I'm already at a level where I'm dying to play those songs anyway.  And, if I need to, there are a couple of songs I've found in G (e.g., Work Song by Butterfield).  That song along should keep my practicing for a long time.  If you are still reading this review, then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp, add it to your cart.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"guitarist passion blue matter time

{"reviewText":"I'm not a pro by any means.  I am enjoying this guitar.  It has all I expected it to have in terms of playability and range.  It _may_ tend to overdrive a little bit.  More than my other guitars (again not a pro).  One of the screws by the jack was loose, nearly stripped, when I got it.  A drop of wood glue fixed it.

Last year, I bought a set of Fender Custom Shop Texas Specials directly from Alto's web site. Over the past year, I received a bunch of Amazon gift certificates and wanted to get myself a Shure SM7b. When I saw that I could get the mic from Alto Music, it was a no brainer. I was purchasing from my local music store through Amazon. As for the mic, it's an SM7b, and it's everything I was looking for, despite it being a low output mic. It's smooth, has a sexy low end color, has no harshness, brittleness, or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers. I'm recording in an untreated basement, and this mic is perfect for when I'm singing loud rock stuff; it only picks up what's right in front of it and none of the room. I'm using a Focusrite 2i2, which is great for loud singing, but I'm picking up a Cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well. For me the mic has been all it's cracked up to be.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"buying gear alto music since trusted guitar helped make right decision need budget last year bought set fender

{"reviewText":"I've been recording professionally for 27 years; Music, radio commercials and television mostly. So I'll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase.I've owned and used so many mics and brands through the years I can't remember them all but I can I say I've never had a bad A-T. 4033's, 4050's and 4080's I use every week and have for years, the 4033 going back to the mid 90's and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the A-T family. You have no idea the % of recordings that you're hearing this brand on, it's used by almost every studio on every continent, I work in the US, Italy to Scotland and can attest to this. But first let me tell you, very simply, where the negative reviewers went wrong.This is a XLR connection phantom powered mic, which is pro and best. So it requires a phantom powered XLR input, which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces. Which you should really purchase along with this, if you haven't already, because for around $100 you'll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring, you'll find one by searching audio interfaces. I have a RolandRoland TRI CAPTURE Audio Interfaceand a Focusrite I use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don't need Avid HD's to get started. Audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter. Getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been SOP since the dawn of digital. I see that small USB mixers are available which would be another option. Don't try an adapter on it, it won't work, as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor, but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want. It doesn't come with the cord, what a surprise! Quality cords will cost about half the price of this, but a $15 version will probably do for most.It doesn't come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like. Work with it, you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do. You'll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeShure Popper Stopper Pop Filteris the usual, but I can also recommend using 2 large $1.49 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen. This isn't about being cheap, there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don't work at strange angles and you'll probably always need one or the other.This does not come with a stand, so pick up a boom stand if you don't have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over, 18 wheelers also tip over.RecommendedUse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they've put a faux plastic one. If it's possible, you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks, eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the wayMicrophone Flange Male. For desktop users, here's what I'd do. Using large Command strips and Velcro I'd fasten this to the deskAdjustable Desk Microphone Standand attach thisTelescoping Mini-BoomHere's another optionMXL Mics MXL-BCD-STANDUnderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting, if you need something figure it out, your clean, quiet recording is proof that it works.I can't justify comparing this to my $500 to $4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it. $82 wouldn't have bought a case for most of my condensers. It sure beats most non electret, electrostatic DC bias or dynamic style mics. The 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue. Also individual mics have a sound, of the eight 4033's I have, I prefer 3 of them and use them the most. So when reviewers say it's bright, I say compared to what? I can tell you what it sounds like.....KA-CHING! a great sound in audio recording. Uh huh, I know of one professional recording it's on and the client was clueless that I used an $82 mic. Think about it, would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago? Have you heard good 70's recordings? Anyone purchasing equipment because it \"sounds\" better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it. Lot's of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don't ignore them but ask yourself this, do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities? Any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost $400 and won't be half of what you'll achieve by improving your recording technique.This type of mic is excellent for overhead, acoustics, amps or brass and of course vocals, really most recording needs, having a less uni and more omni, cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it's better suited to recording. Just understand you can't get too loud near it or you'll overdrive it since it's designed for up to screaming vocals, so back off with loud amps and brass, which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it'll pick up your AC ducts and your neighbor's TV. That, is a good thing, what's bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment, so don't blame a mic for your extraneous room noise. You can't just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind, just quiet, anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical, rather than electronic, signal to noise ratio. A 10db pad will reduce output but doesn't affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won't help, that's not even its purpose, I suggest reading this on acoustics and foam, music.tutsplus dot com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to-acoustic-treatment--audio-1274 (just replace the [dot]). Turn off your heat/air, be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 AM, when the world's a quieter place and that will really help, you'll likely hear how loud your computer fans are. You can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls, or buy used office partitions but you need quiet, I've known acoustic players who've worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing. If this is what your budget allows for it's an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost. I keep saying \"this type of mic\" and the reason why is because A-T sells 14 models like this style up to $3000. This model is the lowest priced but you're buying a reputable brand. If your future plans include using only one mic, without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware, you can look here.Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB MicrophoneOr hereAudio Technica AT2020USB+ Cardioid Condenser Microphone w/Pop FilterThis is not my advice, you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface. This model is not USB.Now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds, I won't tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won't apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio, descriptions are worthless, only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters. This is important, all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn't, the recording cannot sound better than the source, so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone. Accurate or inaccurate, not good or bad, there's a difference. It's during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound. Apply these same thoughts to your home stereo, saying instead, playback cannot sound better than the recording and that's why accuracy is important in your monitors.So search out any info you don't understand and don't expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling, training and having worked in a professional setting. If you're lucky like I was, after 1 year of tech school I worked on site repair (studios often need PT) and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next 3, then after 3 years of work (TV) with another year of school I became a studio owner. Real recording involves a facility, equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital. So study electronics, acoustics, the auditory cortex, everything audio, train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day, it never stops. When making any purchases I recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn't mean you're educated in its use. So yes, I also don't recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother, unless.....But everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording, quit all that sleeping, eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record! Just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk, I have. So keep up the research because no man knows it all and I'm just here to help you out. If you need a good, small, inexpensive stereo amp check this one out.

{"reviewText":"I've owned a Seymour Duncan Woody for several months now, and have had a chance to try it out with various amps, with the pickup tipped for a stronger low end or high end, and so on.  This is an excellent value and is basically as feedback free as you're likely to get from an acoustic guitar pickup.  The one thing I've found is that I get a significantly more natural acoustic guitar sound playing the Woody through my Ampeg bass amp than through my Peavey guitar amp.  The high ends are too grating through an electric guitar amp and there's a tendency for distortion to creep in, even with the clean setting.  Through the bass amp, though, the tone is absolutely clean and clear.  The pickup is easy enough to install and remove and it's easy to get it to sit low enough that it doesn't interfere with finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would.  The other great feature of this pickup is the look; the natural wood finish actually enhances the look of the guitar.  If you are looking for an acoustic guitar pickup, this is the one to buy!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"owned seymour duncan woody several month chance try various amp pickup tipped stronger low end high end excellent value basically feedback free likely get acoustic guitar pickup one thing found get significantly natural acoustic guitar sound playing woody ampeg bass amp peavey guitar amp high end grating electric guitar amp tendency distortion creep even clean setting bass amp though tone absolutely clean clear pickup easy enough install remove easy get sit low enough interfere finger picking sound hole pickup would great feature pickup look natural wood finish actually enhances look guitar looking acoustic guitar pickup one buy","words":["owned","seymour","duncan","woody","several","month","chance","try","various","amp","pickup","tipped","stronger","low","end","high","end","excellent","value","basically","feedback","free","likely","get","acoustic","guitar","pickup","one","thing","found","get","significantly","natural","acoustic","guitar","sound","playing","woody","ampeg","bass","amp","peavey","guitar","amp","high","end","grating","electric","guitar","amp","tendency","distortion","creep","even","clean","setting","bass","amp","though","tone","absolutely","clean","clear","pickup","easy","enough","install","remove","easy","get","sit","low","enough","interfere","finger","picking","sound","hole","pickup","would","great","feature","pickup","look","natural","wood","finish","actually","enhances","look","guitar","looking","acoustic","guitar","pickup","one","buy"],"filtered_words":["owned","seymour","duncan","woody","several","month","chance","try","various","amp","pickup","tipped","stronger","low","end","high","end","excellent","value","basically","feedback","free","likely","get","acoustic","guitar","pickup","one","thing","found","get","significantly","natural","acoustic","guitar","sound","playing","woody","ampeg","bass","amp","peavey","guitar","amp","high","end","grating","electric","guitar","amp","tendency","distortion","creep","even","clean","setting","bass","amp","though","tone","absolutely","clean","clear","pickup","easy","enough","install","remove","easy","get","sit","low","enough","interfere","finger","picking","sound","hole","pickup","great","feature","pickup","look","natural","wood","finish","actually","enhances","look","guitar","looking","acoustic","guitar","pickup","one","buy"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[80,113,309,313,346,453,460,626,664,677,696,703,741,750,760,815,904,1061,1073,1166,1279,1315,1357,1406,1447,1473,1578,1611,1647,1716,1872,1934,1946,1977,2039,2080,2091,2116,2378,2403,2513,2576,2590,2631,2968,3185,3385,3411,3708,3857,4016,4227,4232,4273,4375,4426,4667,4693,4748,4781,4803,4864,4926,4939,4988],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[80,113,309,313,346,453,460,626,664,677,696,703,741,750,760,815,904,1061,1073,1166,1279,1315,1357,1406,1447,1473,1578,1611,1647,1716,1872,1934,1946,1977,2039,2080,2091,2116,2378,2403,2513,2576,2590,2631,2968,3185,3385,3411,3708,3857,4016,4227,4232,4273,4375,4426,4667,4693,4748,4781,4803,4864,4926,4939,4988],"values":[2.197419490113369,4.173607998474943,3.207924511271212,3.4102029241214598,4.3534011089155396,8.025517096816012,4.572763937389843,23.334573004706648,4.692908249231906,4.6210825146606505,5.3418761229330975,5.365002020594019,3.4102029241214598,1.2009241203572432,4.1616134592103515,2.360821161048281,5.077319948142239,2.9262847532753935,3.8843448980258435,2.713823092839279,3.7639323578304356,3.6049912496805447,5.547323577387973,2.1149505782573685,3.1770798359201136,3.573242551365964,3.6988687644833735,3.4310680625854215,4.49127090313866,3.2649411917114475,5.680854970012496,7.778191001568882,4.7935517750115935,5.547323577387973,4.205765110109475,4.238990757737795,7.290292882446597,5.43706351717927,2.261724120476865,3.381131109299483,6.8383077587035395,3.3013088358823226,2.801656512714457,3.8380403299841572,7.219227881968454,3.2598521222039762,2.822744074334553,5.356010457379283,5.125329167328599,2.152815183876615,6.031225722804342,3.244738484393928,2.7289253191168985,7.038978454165691,4.245770444723174,4.6446175953266815,3.968344872438582,2.695173032312007,5.0635773530756065,2.0831513965644297,6.21054832235491,3.5978483621681643,11.779094746579526,4.591961124764543,9.202948086544549]}}

{"reviewText":"If you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about DigiTech effects pedals, they'll tell you to stay away from them...except for this one.  That's because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the $100 TS-9 Tubescreamer.In fact the TS-9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to.  This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone.  Notes will sing and chords will really crunch, especially in blues and classic rock.  But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost, I've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects, to really push them to new levels.But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ.  Virtually any distortion pedal has a \"Tone\" control that will make the tone darker or brighter.  But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble (or vice versa), you may not find the sound you want.  That's what's so great about the Bad Monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak, you can fatten it up.  If it's too muddy, you can add treble.  And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like.Construction is extremely durable - die cast metal, and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal.  The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal, but I find that easier to use.If you're a beginning player or a player on a budget, this would be an outstanding pedal to own, along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal.  There's really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer, if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear.  But even for player where money is not an object, don't overlook the Bad Monkey.  It might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you'll need.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"listen read many pro guitarist techie say digitech effect pedal tell stay away except one digitech

They bendnicely and sustain just as well.I know guitar strings can be a personal thing, and there are more expensive pure nickels out there, butat this price point try a set of these as well. You may be surprised.I have rated this set at '4' stars because only after about 16 hours of practice the 'D' string windingbroke at the second and third fret of my Gibson Standard. No damage to the frets and it was easilydiscovered because the string sounded dull, almost dead. Strange.I recently went 'electric' again after 20+ years. So electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again. That said, I never had an acoustic wound string have its winding come loose in over 30years  of playing.I put another set on my electric and have had no further problems. I have not heard of this happeningto anyone else. Maybe its no big deal, so no one remarks on it...UPDATE 07/14/2013: I am still using DR Blues on my guitars and have not had any further problems withthem..UPDATE 01/08/2014: I just had the D string windings break on a new set.

{"reviewText":"Like many guitar players, I have a few effects pedals of different brands and I needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them. At one of the guitar forums I frequent I started a thread about powering a TS9 Tube Screamer with a non-proprietary nine volt power supply, One Spot came back twice in the replies. Since that time I acquired a two more pedals so now I really needed something. I looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me. I got creative, I ordered a One Spot Combo Pack then bought some 2\" wide industrial strength Velcro and built my own board that fits in my hard-shell brief case.So far so good, after two months of band practices the One Spot 9V DC adapter with the Multi Plug daisy chain cable does what I bought it for, my little four pedal setup works beautifully. I'm perfectly happy it. The One Spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source. The Combo Pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the Multi Plug daisy chain.If you are thinking about buying this product, do it.

{"reviewText":"More knobs are not always better.  In the case of this pedal, the controls are really sensitive, there's a pretty big mid hump that's hard to dial out, and the low end control can make things really boomy, or add a little chunk to the sound.  You can do a lot with it, but I struggle to find what it does best, because it doesn't really do edge of distortion well (it doesn't clean up), and it's not a really high gain distortion pedal, but it can just add a bit of tightness, hair metal mids, or thump to a standard OD sound.  Basically, if you have your amp set for 70s rock, you can stomp on this and get Motley Crue or maybe Bark at the Moon era Ozzy.Like a tubescreamer, this thing lets a little bit of the clean signal through so you hear the distorted guitar mixed with clean signal.  The circuit design is nothing like a tube screamer, but it can work as a substitute ( I think if you wanted the tube screamer sound, theJoyo JF-01 \"Vintage Overdrive\" Pedalwould be better just for simplicity sake and being more of a clone).So it's not bad, but its just not on the level of boutique pedals and their clones.

{"reviewText":"One of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track. A pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs. They can  be configured as a master/slave set-up with a single link cable (a 1/4 inch speaker cable), or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs, assuming five inputs per CM-30. In reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient.The low, mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ. I have run both aRoland RD-300NX Digital PianoandRoland V-Combo VR-700. The grand piano setting on the RD-300NX sounds like the real thing out of this amp, as does the B3 emulation from the V-Combo.I did a direct comparison with this against aMackie SRM150 5.25-Inch Compact Active PA Systemand the sound of this beat it hand's down. Bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range.Vocals through the channel with the XLR are adequate, but not particularly spectacular. Also, there is no phantom power or ground lift features, so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances. That leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances.I use mine as a powered main, but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box. That is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you. However, once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument's volume and EQ controls.There are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand. First, the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the CM-30 to the floor not exceed 43 inches. I agree. This may be relatively small, but it's heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high. It's easy to tip over, especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"one sufficient small venue main keyboard amp

{"reviewText":"Overall dimensions 6 3/4\" x 6 1/2\" x 2 1/4\". Very nice travel size. Sound is about what you would expect. It is basically a toy. If you use more than 2 (of 10 max) gain, it sounds awful. I turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level. Tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies.

{"reviewText":"Picked up some Blue Steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone. Also was the last to pick it up for $118.50 shipped to my door. If you like a parlor guitar, this might be for you. The case is kick ass too, easily a $50 value.Update: After putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner, along with putting on new strings, this guitar rocks. Putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone. This is my go-to guitar. Sounds good and has great intonation. The only fore-seeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning.

{"reviewText":"Scratch free, durable, machine washable. I use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much, much longer. You place the cloth next to a string, then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces, sides and top of the string, then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times, then repeat on the remaining strings. I then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard, then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys. Takes a matter of moments and works great.

{"reviewText":"Simple, compact, well constructed, easy to use, and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo, designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make, each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar, Heritage Cherry Sunburst), aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar, Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge, andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck, it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock.

{"reviewText":"Some of the complaints are well warranted about this cheap unit.  First of all I had to fumble around with it for almost 15 minutes to get it to open straight because it seems like I got a previously-returned unit that some other customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to manhandle it because I could tell it would break if bent it the wrong way with too much force.  I was about to give up but I felt bad to do the return because I didnt want to make Amazon lose money and this is a weird shaped box and probably costs over $8 in postage to send back to them.But eventually I figured it out.  I am a 5 ft 10 inches tall man and this stand is tall enough because I opened it all the way and there was still an inch or 2 to spare if I wanted to raise it to the maximum.  Looks like those complaining about the height did not realize that all 3 segments can be stretched out to reveal the full height (They probably only raised 2 out of the 3 segments).So for the price I think you get what you pay for and since I just want a stand that will stay in my bedroom at home I think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you are getting it for a kid under 18 years old I recommend you buy a sturdier unit than this because they will probably break it in short order.  And then you will be out the fifteen bucks plus have to buy a new one.The truth is that its a flimsy piece of junk, okay for a responsible adult that will treat it with great care (such as myself) but not for children or drunks, it is very fragile and easy to break.  I took the advice and tightened the adjustment knobs for height only finger tight without great force as previous reviewers attest that it is easy to strip out the bolt if you over-tighten so be very, very careful.I will keep mine but if I had to purchase a second unit I would not buy this one because I dont like flimsy junk and I feel even my large dog could knock this down and break the dang thing.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"complaint well warranted cheap unit first fumble around almost minute get open straight seems like got previously returned unit customer must bent arm

{"reviewText":"Sometime round 1994, my friend Kendal built several of these for our band. They were great and incredibly handy. I havent investigated this, but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not. Certainly, if he did, he never patented it or anything.Anyway, flash forward 18 years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes, resenting batteries and individual power supplies. I thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again....and so i did. This one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters. So far, it has lived up to my expectations. I cat speak to playing out with this yet, as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio, but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose. So, for such a simple device, you really cant beat it...unless you dont really use boxes. Personally, i presently have my wah, distortion, chorus, overdrive, delay, slap echo, and flanger running through it. Everything works great.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"sometime round friend kendal built several band great incredibly handy havent investigated wondered later started seeing marketed

{"reviewText":"Sounds simply great!  As greasy as a Pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be.  Great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs; it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume, it changes its distortion (the louder, the more distorted).  The Pignose power supply (Pignose AC9 Power Supply for Pignose 7100) is helpful when been home, but also works with 6 AA batteries.  You can also amplify it's sound by connecting it to a higher-watt amp.  It comes with really nice looking stickers.  I'm planning to keep it for years.Update on review(Jan 9, 2013).I admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps, but as time goes by, I just fall more in love with my Piggy!  I've learned to use better it's own volume combined with the guitar's.I have other amps of higher power that can get a LOT louder that the Pignose, but I just LOVE the level of distortion it gives; I cannot get this crunch with the other amps, no matter how much pedals, bells, whistles I have tried... This crunch is unique and the world loves it, as simple and plain as that.  The good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch I so much fell in love with.The 7 chords give a clean amazing sweet-grumble (the one that make teenage girls sigh for you...) with high volume on the Piggy and low on the guitar.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"sound simply great greasy pignose

{"reviewText":"Stumbled upon this while looking for another pedal. I read the reviews and decided to give it a chance; how could I lose at this price? I put it in my cart and continued shopping.Guess what...the reviewers weren't lying (except that one guy who gave it a 2..what a BS review)!It arrived today, and I decided to give it a quick workout. I grabbed a small amp (Fender Frontman 15) and plugged in my Strat (with a Seymour Duncan Hotrail at the bridge) and gave it a go. The 'quick workout' turned into an hour long jam session as I got caught up in what this pedal can do. It turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather! With the mic at off X, middle set at Hot, and California and 3/4 gain...this thing just SCREAMS for solos and is very heavy for rhythm. I spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away.The Tweed and Brit settings were great too, as I tweaked a multitude of tones from this beast. I've had Behringer pedals before and even though they were decent (vintage delay, slow motion, compressor, eq), I didn't get excited about them. In fact, I sold the delay and slow mo recently. This pedal however, is going to get some serious use. I'm not crazy about the plastic casing, but it seems sturdy enough. I can't recommend this pedal enough...the reviews were right!

{"reviewText":"The D'Addario sets are good stuff. I got turned onto them about a decade ago by a coworker. The color coded ends are great whether you are new at changing strings or just want it more automated if you are an old veteran. With stretching, they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them, too) is that there are only a handful of string makers, and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series, and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets, and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets, but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies, though. With offshore production a standard thing now, it's no telling where they actually come from anyways.

{"reviewText":"The J74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments.  They are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound.  However because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier.  Also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down.  But the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new.  This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively.  One thing is sure, that the J74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins.  Some folks move to the heavier J75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops.  The J74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work.  Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"j sort default string mandolin dealer put instrument bright brassy new give decent punch sound however bronze discolor finger tarnish pretty quickly especially summer finger sweatier also since round wound harder fret flat wound string harder shift people like change often like day whenever play gig get nice bright brassy punch new get point work harder get volume less elastic less lively one thing sure j loud zingy dealer put mandolin folk move heavier j get even louder fatter woof chop j brighter aggressive flatwound string cut ensemble work make sure change often get best performance","words":["j","sort","default","string","mandolin","dealer","put","instrument","bright","brassy","new","give","decent","punch","sound","however","bronze","discolor","finger","tarnish","pretty","quickly","especially","summer","finger","sweatier","also","since","round","wound","harder","fret","flat","wound","string","harder","shift","people","like","change","often","like","day","whenever","play","gig","get","nice","bright","brassy","punch","new","get","point","work","harder","get","volume","less","elastic","less","lively","one","thing","sure","j","loud","zingy","dealer","put","mandolin","folk","move","heavier","j","get","even","louder","fatter","woof","chop","j","brighter","aggressive","flatwound","string","cut","ensemble","work","make","sure","change","often","get","best","performance"],"filtered_words":["j","sort","default","string","mandolin","dealer","put","instrument","bright","brassy","new","give","decent","punch","sound","however","bronze","discolor","finger","tarnish","pretty","quickly","especially","summer","finger","sweatier","also","since","round","wound","harder","fret","flat","wound","string","harder","shift","people","like","change","often","like","day","whenever","play","gig","get","nice","bright","brassy","punch","new","get","point","work","harder","get","volume","less","elastic","less","lively","one","thing","sure","j","loud","zingy","dealer","put","mandolin","folk","move","heavier","j","get","even","louder","fatter","woof","chop","j","brighter","aggressive","flatwound","string","cut","ensemble","work","make","sure","change","often","get","best","performance"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[7,350,387,406,486,499,542,585,720,759,763,815,911,1166,1195,1206,1282,1283,1287,1406,1419,1513,1557,1821,2006,2058,2143,2173,2251,2345,2377,2379,2545,2576,2833,2918,3000,3059,3089,3173,3265,3266,3330,3370,3391,3525,3567,3660,3783,3792,3857,3871,3919,4032,4133,4185,4240,4263,4351,4409,4416,4420,4424,4426,4481,4527,4556,4623,4875,4897],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[7,350,387,406,486,499,542,585,720,759,763,815,911,1166,1195,1206,1282,1283,1287,1406,1419,1513,1557,1821,2006,2058,2143,2173,2251,2345,2377,2379,2545,2576,2833,2918,3000,3059,3089,3173,3265,3266,3330,3370,3391,3525,3567,3660,3783,3792,3857,3871,3919,4032,4133,4185,4240,4263,4351,4409,4416,4420,4424,4426,4481,4527,4556,4623,4875,4897],"values":[8.010188829294647,3.8563056779614504,6.258360287519311,9.47278672234329,6.017327206633709,13.676615517407079,3.23478815354076,5.272665064578147,4.482612840395546,3.13812874933567,2.4804341095176548,1.1804105805241405,2.9998334412982057,1.3569115464196395,5.941803637528401,3.7723712264763,3.9529993027639216,10.421702681533521,2.827674240442412,2.1149505782573685,9.45068704997012,5.175760020955491,4.09453947499925,5.527713474002019,7.740454032960117,6.751296381713909,6.145160578143594,2.2349574094324343,5.016695326325803,4.572763937389843,5.835005649839755,6.1007088155727605,10.092255726079483,6.602617671764645,3.333569698100544,3.942898206777418,2.946487460592913,5.247218984937636,3.9378856649538734,3.1269554487375446,5.522630964797602,5.770467128702183,2.579170936514875,1.9506964829791245,3.7067739439904868,1.974977939529989,2.6780052286896416,15.537379592103374,2.3956565022132232,1.974275938799159,2.152815183876615,5.015148836834417,2.6851226964585053,6.79694516867194,3.0541181247852784,8.137590742833801,3.7723712264763,2.787313637355053,3.9529993027639216,3.9529993027639216,3.467882035708138,4.054419481209825,6.240470757947919,7.74102932554447,5.978106493480428,2.6904926307259824,6.751296381713909,6.017327206633709,6.29176405233547,4.749547853093163]}}

The dive bombs, reverse dive bombs, and flutter are there. Don't expect a 2 octave bottom, because it doesn't do that.You will not sound like a Thin Lizzy dual guitar lead, but you can get that Bryan May, Queensryche meets the Allman Brothers harmonies in

{"reviewText":"The software itself (sound/interface): 4.5 starsThe installation and activation: 2 starsPROS:1) The drums included in EZ Drummer are the most realistic \"computer drums\" I have ever heard. I'm using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound.2) All sounds are MIDI, which means you can manipulate how you see fit. I use EZ Drummer with MixCraft and have modified pretty much every beat I have used so far with the built-in MIDI editing capabilities.3) The interface is clean an easy to use. You just drag a beat from the EZ Drummer window into your DAW.CONS:When I was reading reviews I just thought the people complaining about the install/activation were being wusses. I mean seriously, how hard can it be? Well, they were right, it sucks. It took me two hours to get it all working.My advice: Don't even install the app from the included disc. Instead, just go create yourself an account at toontrack.com and download the most up-to-date version and ALL the patches for the modules that come with it.My experience:1) Try to install from disc. Fails with a 1308.2) Google'd the problem. Found out I needed to get a toontrack.com account and download the installer from there.3) Downloaded the ~650 MB ZIPPED installer. Then, I had to unzip the 18,000 files, which took about 20 minutes on my PC.4) I was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install.5) Then I

{"reviewText":"The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"thing pick plectrum prefer really matter

I love that you can use the extra pads to angle them any way you want for your set up. These pads make my bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING. It's like I'm using actual studio monitors.

{"reviewText":"These Planet Waves locking straps work very well on most guitars with standard-size strap pins.  Once locked, they're not going anywhere.  What you need to be careful about is that you have to use some common sense - the locking end, once fastened, can act as a lever to pull the pin out of the guitar if pressure is put on it a certain way.  For this reason, you would want to be careful when using it on acoustic, hollow, or semi-hollow guitars.  And I certainly wouldn't keep this strap on a guitar when it's going to be carried in a gig bag.  Keeping this in mind, these straps are an efficient, inexpensive way to be sure your guitar won't break loose of its strap.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"planet wave locking strap work well guitar standard size strap pin locked going anywhere need careful use common sense locking end fastened act lever pull pin guitar pressure put certain way reason would want careful using acoustic hollow semi hollow guitar certainly keep strap guitar going carried gig bag keeping mind strap efficient inexpensive way sure guitar break loose strap","words":["planet","wave","locking","strap","work","well","guitar","standard","size","strap","pin","locked","going","anywhere","need","careful","use","common","sense","locking","end","fastened","act","lever","pull","pin","guitar","pressure","put","certain","way","reason","would","want","careful","using","acoustic","hollow","semi","hollow","guitar","certainly","keep","strap","guitar","going","carried","gig","bag","keeping","mind","strap","efficient","inexpensive","way","sure","guitar","break","loose","strap"],"filtered_words":["planet","wave","locking","strap","work","well","guitar","standard","size","strap","pin","locked","going","anywhere","need","careful","use","common","sense","locking","end","fastened","act","lever","pull","pin","guitar","pressure","put","certain","way","reason","want","careful","using","acoustic","hollow","semi","hollow","guitar","certainly","keep","strap","guitar","going","carried","gig","bag","keeping","mind","strap","efficient","inexpensive","way","sure","guitar","break","loose","strap"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[38,133,157,173,220,306,415,447,453,511,542,661,668,673,926,960,1207,1332,1537,1597,1821,1881,1928,1970,2479,2490,2712,2811,2944,2967,2968,3184,3192,3351,3375,3785,3871,3986,4221,4288,4391,4527,4594,4689,4803],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[38,133,157,173,220,306,415,447,453,511,542,661,668,673,926,960,1207,1332,1537,1597,1821,1881,1928,1970,2479,2490,2712,2811,2944,2967,2968,3184,3192,3351,3375,3785,3871,3986,4221,4288,4391,4527,4594,4689,4803],"values":[5.845309970449629,1.3296557991338742,1.3764038509398002,8.98254180627732,5.228869846269439,3.9632034729381633,3.4431894231177664,2.1061045213763325,2.6751723656053374,4.6112302182176395,3.23478815354076,4.682326139901369,3.4310680625854215,4.054419481209825,5.802215827016764,2.164629667290378,3.6121855253145716,5.2108513407667605,1.9792003244098373,3.5907561338586724,2.7638567370010096,3.942898206777418,5.452013397583649,4.517704160206816,3.903484238236541,7.905998605527843,2.287305809188598,6.4636143092621285,3.6452160509910536,3.372571855903813,2.4064092939894848,4.106304316578837,3.068686540613569,13.188470014436973,7.444443562273855,6.345831273605746,2.5075744184172084,9.8374298359312,4.345853903280156,4.4570795383903805,4.683065984136857,1.3452463153629912,2.6174640479846905,9.089710298545533,5.175456935295758]}}

They are color coded which helps a bunch in getting the right string in the right hole as long as you aren't color blind. They go on, sound bright, and keep that new string sound a bit longer than uncoated strings. Had a salesman tell me once about these coated strings that they last forever, you only have to change them every 3 months or so. I had to reply that forever just doesn't last as long as it used to. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less, that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. That means more guitar playing and less guitar stringing which is a no brainer in my book.

{"reviewText":"These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull, and I absolutely love their sound, feel, and durability. The one reason I actually needed them because my G string broke while I was tuning too fast. The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes, these strings have a great, uplifting sound to them, hard to soft strums. Playing feels great with them, nothing out of the ordinary either strumming or the fretboard feel, clean and smooth. When replacing, I ran into no problems, quick and easy. I love the strings and their price, definitely will stick with this brand as well.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"string originally strung godin seagull absolutely love sound feel durability one reason actually needed g string broke tuning fast sound almost identical addario describes string great uplifting sound hard soft strum playing feel great nothing ordinary either strumming fretboard feel clean smooth replacing ran problem quick easy love string price definitely stick brand well","words":["string","originally","strung","godin","seagull","absolutely","love","sound","feel","durability","one","reason","actually","needed","g","string","broke","tuning","fast","sound","almost","identical","addario","describes","string","great","uplifting","sound","hard","soft","strum","playing","feel","great","nothing","ordinary","either","strumming","fretboard","feel","clean","smooth","replacing","ran","problem","quick","easy","love","string","price","definitely","stick","brand","well"],"filtered_words":["string","originally","strung","godin","seagull","absolutely","love","sound","feel","durability","one","reason","actually","needed","g","string","broke","tuning","fast","sound","almost","identical","addario","describes","string","great","uplifting","sound","hard","soft","strum","playing","feel","great","nothing","ordinary","either","strumming","fretboard","feel","clean","smooth","replacing","ran","problem","quick","easy","love","string","price","definitely","stick","brand","well"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[113,125,157,162,288,300,365,518,750,760,815,1085,1166,1240,1369,1447,1626,1635,1698,1738,1755,2085,2162,2569,2834,2944,2979,3115,3491,3566,3834,4016,4099,4126,4193,4222,4263,4292,4357,4376,4399,4781,4859,4868,4897],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[113,125,157,162,288,300,365,518,750,760,815,1085,1166,1240,1369,1447,1626,1635,1698,1738,1755,2085,2162,2569,2834,2944,2979,3115,3491,3566,3834,4016,4099,4126,4193,4222,4263,4292,4357,4376,4399,4781,4859,4868,4897],"values":[4.173607998474943,2.876629162829533,1.3764038509398002,5.770467128702183,3.1794190182732853,5.4295405417315905,4.817362423705312,5.498533413218542,2.4018482407144863,2.0808067296051758,1.1804105805241405,3.7894656598356002,4.0707346392589185,4.676996176746549,5.452013397583649,3.1770798359201136,4.661492052998527,6.345831273605746,2.5354719219540995,1.676122566480083,5.572641385372264,5.709842506885749,2.874900553928915,3.003755014951387,4.238990757737795,3.6452160509910536,3.401392294439305,7.379088117389181,5.4295405417315905,3.2151796821523835,3.3146246118580946,3.015612861402171,3.419091871538706,3.404320554218393,3.163158497401505,4.703603538348654,2.787313637355053,3.364085242026494,3.893868779537099,2.931754229079929,5.407561635012815,2.0831513965644297,3.908326862712329,3.8843448980258435,6.332730470790884]}}

{"reviewText":"Think of this as an artist's tool.  And for every job there is the 'right' tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"think artist tool every job right tool best distortion pedal

{"reviewText":"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential.

{"reviewText":"This is NOT my first guitar. Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins. It's not. Here's what it is: An exceedingly well-constucted, AMAZINGLY playable guitar. Fit, finish, feel and action were all VERY nice... Sound on the other hand? Let's face it. It's plywood all around. It SOUNDS like plywood. But that doesn't distract from the fact that it's a great guitar for $100 bucks.It's a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar. It's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar. Leave it in your car to practice at lunch. Leave it in the office. ANY guitar is better than no guitar... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars.Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box...

I wish the TS jacks were top/bottom instead of side by side, seems it would take 1/4 right angle connectors better. One gets in the way of the other.

It does not vary the pitch.You have control over the \"depth\" or \"amount\" of effect, and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound.A very simple, popular effect that I wouldn't want to live without in some form or another.Pretty teal green color.As with all Boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged.I have no idea how fast

{"reviewText":"This is an interesting, limited effect pedal. I bought it mainly to use with my (non-pedal) steel guitar. On a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers, and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells. However, I play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.This pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. It's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. Since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. I combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.I tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. For chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song. I haven't really found many instances where it's useful there either, as I normally don't want volume swells for solos on guitar, but on steel guitar, it works very well.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"interesting limited effect pedal bought mainly use non pedal steel guitar pedal steel bend note pedal lever steel player use volume pedal swell however

I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele, and it is easy to add, move, remove. With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards, and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo, Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.

{"reviewText":"This is nearly identical to theGuardian Cases CG-020-B Bass Guitar Caseat about half the cost. However, there are some issues with this case as well as limitations.First the issues: while the covering appears to be stitched on, it is - for the most part - glued on, and if the case is left in a hot, unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges. On the other hand, someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car (or garage or other storage space) for prolonged periods. However, you should be aware of the issue, if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers, imagine the effect on your bass.The limitations are simple: the case, while a hard shell design, is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic. The top is relatively flimsy as are the sides. This is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs, but if you have a heavy road schedule, and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band's gear, this case will not afford you the protection of an ATA-style case.Also note that I have only used this case for a Fender Jazz Bass, so any long-scale J- or P-style basses will fit. I cannot be sure about other brands and models.I mentioned an ATA-style case as a better solution, and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules. For less demanding protection I recommend that you also consider this case (which I purchased as an upgrade when I became aware of the issues and limitations of the Musician's Gear model:SKB Electric Bass Rectangular Hardshell, standard latches, handle.If you still opt for the Musician's Gear case, you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig

{"reviewText":"This is the best little guitar pedal adapter I've used, and I've used many over the last three decades. It's exceptionally quiet, which many are not, and it puts out 9.6 volts, which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!I've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals, but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit.

This is perfect for that.

{"reviewText":"This little stand serves so many purposes for me..At home, it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when I want to test out different pedal configurations.At my gig, It holds my presonus mixer, A laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers..  It is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide AND Short or Tall..As well, I have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it..  I plan on using this one day to hold my Ableton Live machine as well as a small 2 octave keyboard and I will use the mic boom arm at that point!

{"reviewText":"This pedal does exactly what it says it's supposed to. It boosts the guitars signal. It does it really well, with very little to no noise. The thing I like most is that it is not a \"sledge hammer\" type pedal or overdrive. The input signal is cleanly boosted. What you put into the input comes out the same only louder. It starts with no change in the signal and allows you to raise up the gain very slowly. It just gives the signal from your guitar a stronger output to whatever you are plugging into (amp, mixer, effects or pedal board). This pedal arrived at my door on a Friday afternoon so I took it to a gig that night without trying it first (something I don't normally do). The first two times I used this pedal were that night (Friday) and the next (Saturday). I thought it worked great for my needs. A few days later I read a review that said this pedal had a noticable hiss. Since I didn't remember hearing any, I got it out at home and plugged it into my amp (I have the same amp at home that I use live). When you activate it with the tone set flat on the pedal and the volume about 12:00, there is a very sight hiss (no noise when bypassed). For me it is a very minor hiss that in live situations with all the normal room noises I never heard at all. This may not be true for all amps and maybe some high gain input amps may handle this signal differently. I know for sure it is a lot quieter than almost any effects pedal I have ever owned and I have box full from 35 years of playing. I am using a Vox VT30 which is a modeling amp with lots of bulit in effects (delays, chorus, flanger, compressors etc.) These days I don't use any additional outboard effects (except a BBA Sonic Stomp that I never turn off) so siganl from my guitar hits my amps input very cleanly. If you use various guitars on gigs, this pedal is very useful. It allows me to quickly match the various guitar output levels and compensate for differences between humbuckers, single coils and piezo pick ups on an acoustic without having to adjust the amp controls. This is a great problem solver for any rig that needs to control the input level to the amp and it does it at a bare bones price.I have owned several Behringer pedals for live work and have some Behringer rack gear in my live audio rack and in my home studio. I gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully. I have never broken or had a problem with any of my Behrinnger gear (including a pair of Behringer 12\" powered speakers mixed with a pair of Mackie 15\" powered mains). I don't intentionally abuse my gear but at 2:00 when your packing up s*** happens but so far my Behringer stuff has never let me down yet and I have had some it for many years. I also keep reading about people worrying about the hard plastic cases on Behringer pedals. Don't worry about it. They are sturdy enough. (Just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage. The battery goes under the pedal switch and the spring that is under the foot switch will probbaly fall out if you are not careful. (To open the battery compartment/foot switch cover just use a pen or small phillips style jewelers screwdriver and push in the black pins on either side of the pedal.)","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"pedal exactly say supposed boost guitar signal really well little noise thing like sledge hammer type pedal overdrive input signal cleanly boosted put

{"reviewText":"This pedal sounds great with my fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker and also very good with my 1960's danelectro tweed amp with it's bright weber ceramic 8 inch speaker. I can use the entire range of the tone knob to go from aggressive growls at the low end to screaming lead tones at the other end, and it never sounds harsh. The clipping is sweet and musical, with a sound very reminiscent to cranked amplifier stacks with their front ends being pushed with overdrive pedals. Sometimes I feed this with my SD-1 or my Danelectro D-2 overdrive and it just puts it over the top. FOR THE PRICE, these pedals are outstanding. The QC may not be perfect, and there are duds out there, but I would say that it is worth the risk, as the circuits in these are just like vintage pedals although they do use cheaper components and boards and such. As long as you dont literally stomp down on the pedal and you dont drop it down the stairs, it will last long enough to make it worth your while. Also, the blue LED is somewhat bright and annoying, but it is a good indicator so I guess it does it's job.

{"reviewText":"This pedal, used in conjunctions with a host of others on my board ('The Labyrinth'), does what it claims to do and more. It seriously boosts the instrument signal from my Tele at a mere 50% level setting and makes the subsequent MXR Distortion + pedal crackle with goodness and increased sustain. I've purchased a host of Behringer guitar pedals during the last year (used, I might add) and am happy with every single one of them. Don't let the cheap price fool ya. I've been using all manner of guitar pedals in my work since the 1970's - yes, I'm \"old\" -  and these stack up against anything similar that more expensive manufacturers have to offer. I'm just glad that I'm getting most of them for under $50 before the world figures out how reliable they are and Behringer jacks the price of everything. Oh yes, I use a OneSpot 9v multi-adapter to power everything, so I cannot comment on how quickly these pedals plow through batteries.

{"reviewText":"This was bought based on the advice of others. I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker.","overall":2.0,"label":0,"clean_text":"bought based advice others cable standard neutrik switchcraft type end fail cable supposed either strain free simply

The top hanger now just serves as a rest, but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"wall hanger good space saving idea one think stress neck depending body neck weight distribution balance made hanging base carved slab wood really support instrument bottom top hanger serf rest depending guitar balance recommend heavy rubber band something stretch across prong tendency guitar tilt forward","words":["wall","hanger","good","space","saving","idea","one","think","stress","neck","depending","body","neck","weight","distribution","balance","made","hanging","base","carved","slab","wood","really","support","instrument","bottom","top","hanger","serf","rest","depending","guitar","balance","recommend","heavy","rubber","band","something","stretch","across","prong","tendency","guitar","tilt","forward"],"filtered_words":["wall","hanger","good","space","saving","idea","one","think","stress","neck","depending","body","neck","weight","distribution","balance","made","hanging","base","carved","slab","wood","really","support","instrument","bottom","top","hanger","serf","rest","depending","guitar","balance","recommend","heavy","rubber","band","something","stretch","across","prong","tendency","guitar","tilt","forward"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[312,328,662,703,815,841,958,966,1168,1404,1419,1676,2074,2244,2335,2369,2545,2708,2749,2928,2972,3004,3173,3191,3217,3344,3411,3502,3567,3796,3798,3949,4112,4116,4188,4375,4573,4618,4803,4826],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[312,328,662,703,815,841,958,966,1168,1404,1419,1676,2074,2244,2335,2369,2545,2708,2749,2928,2972,3004,3173,3191,3217,3344,3411,3502,3567,3796,3798,3949,4112,4116,4188,4375,4573,4618,4803,4826],"values":[7.999522137343922,2.9539362846059034,3.5978483621681643,5.365002020594019,1.1804105805241405,3.903484238236541,3.9279353341007055,5.407561635012815,1.3002579281482092,3.5978483621681643,4.72534352498506,5.625285118857685,4.13025755760133,5.175760020955491,2.608161655322377,7.596247445157429,3.364085242026494,3.9735128425970245,4.987707789452551,5.247218984937636,7.156761489822074,3.739034806208708,3.1269554487375446,9.784795219296452,4.424018676129493,2.2598549610541614,2.6780052286896416,6.108236249570557,2.6780052286896416,3.908326862712329,5.4295405417315905,3.0813449374854924,1.786705026119061,2.4551454055657307,3.9529993027639216,4.245770444723174,5.770467128702183,4.9187149179656,2.070182774118303,2.801656512714457]}}

{"reviewText":"What is there to say. If you're looking at this cable, then you must have some knowledge of tone loss. Simple, if you want a studio quality cable that gives you top notch tone signal, buy Mogami. I have owned hundreds of cables and nothing in this price range touches Mogami.

{"reviewText":"When I first started setting up my little studio, I wanted something that didn't break the budget.  I tried a couple different combo pedal boards, (Digitech 500, Boss ME-70), but quickly realized I wasn't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up.  With not much left, I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro.  Who would think?  This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds, as are most of this line of pedals.  I now own about 12-14 of these of all types, and have never been dissapointed save it's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building, and they all got put away.  Lately, I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills, and joy of joys! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series, they are not so hot.  Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt, or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo.

{"reviewText":"Any product that can make an intermediate-level player like me sound like a pro is a sound investment. The RP255 is an amazing processor loaded with features (looper, drum machine, tuner) and dozens of cool pre-sets (\"Greasr\" is my favorite). You can customize your own sounds but I still haven't gotten tired of Digitech's choices. The AC adaptor (included) allows for hours of rockin' fun.

{"reviewText":"Anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that I am not fond of the Snark displays.  I prefer the \"needle\" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the Snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp.  However, that's me and YMMV, as they say on the Internet.Don't ask, then, why I got a SN-6.  I don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and I like to play with accessories.I am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity.  They all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price.Well, that's not *quite* true.  Some models suffer fits in certain situations.  The rapid fall of the old Intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low E string on a Martin dreadnought.  A web search will reveal countless workarounds.  I (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around.Lately, I've become enamored of theKala KA-UBASSFS Solid Mahogany U-BASS - Fretted.  If you want a tuning challenge, the low bass E string is it.  The SN-6 hardly hiccups.  Other tuners seem to do \"okay\" but require a little coaxing.  Not the SN-6!

{"reviewText":"As a disclaimer, I am not a Big Muff connoisseur.  I've never owned one before this.  I also tend not to like fuzz as an effect.  I'd characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz, maintaining enough definition for chord work.  If you're reading the reviews, you've probably already done your research on the features, but I'll cover them anyway.Three simple controls, Volume - Tone - Sustain, with the Sustain control being more or less a Gain control.  The enclosure is a smaller, pedalboard-friendly size.  The pedal incorporates two of the (supposedly) most popular Big Muff mods with switches, Tone and Wicker.  When Tone is switched off, the Tone control and its tone-shaping circuitry are completely disconnected.  In this mode, the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly, and it also produces a significant volume boost.  The Tone knob does nothing.When Wicker is switched on, it removes three high-frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original Big Muff circuit to smooth out the sound.  Disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher, with a high-end frequency boost.I use this pedal running into a mild overdrive, the Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret, which \"conditions\" the signal.  I play with the Tone off and Wicker on, and even with the Volume and Sustain controls set fairly low, this combination results in a wonderfully thick, massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth.If you're looking to get a Big Muff, and you're not a snob about which version, the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound.  Not to mention that, at this price point, it will be much cheaper than some vintage Muffs.  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"disclaimer big muff connoisseur never owned one also tend like fuzz effect characterize box cross distortion fuzz maintaining enough

{"reviewText":"BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: The MXR Fullbore Metal is a high-octane distortion suitable for modern metal music. It's 3-band EQ with adjustable Midrange Q gives the MXR FM the ability to model virtually every other distortion out there.WHAT I LIKE about the pedal is that it's small, easy to operate, and doesn't take much time to dial in the tone you want. I play with a Marshall JCM2000 DSL50 going into a 1960A 4x12 using a Les Paul Standard, and it sounds amazing. I love the onboard Marshall JCM-flavored tube distortion, but it is more in line with the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (obviously), and not entirely suitable for modern American metalcore. The MXR Fullbore Metal gets me to where I need to go. This is nice because I can use my amp to have a good clean and overdrive channel, and then tap the Fullbore when I need to play metal.WHAT I DISLIKE is that this pedal generates a lot of white noise, so you have to be careful with the Treble and Mid-Q knobs. However I also noticed that the amount of white noise also depended on my amp's EQ settings as well, so know in advance you'll need to spend a good 15-minutes doing a proper setup for recording purposes.WHAT ABOUT THE EH METAL MUFF? I owned a Metal Muff for years, and this pedal totally blows it away. The big &#34;selling point&#34; about the MM is that it has a Top Boost. Big deal. I wrote a review for the MM on Amazon, but in summary, the Top Boost makes everything sound weird and unmusical. Comparing the Top Boost to the Noise Gate in terms of the big &#34;selling point&#34;, the Fullbore's Noise Gate (which has adjustable sensitivity) to me seems like a MUCH better feature when thinking about how tight you want your rhythm guitar or leads to sound.WHAT ABOUT THE BOSS ME-70? I currently own an ME-70, and being totally honest - I think the negative peer pressure and crap guitarist's give each other about multi-effects is because in their mind they think an old-fashioned pedalboard with a thousand bucks worth of pedals is &#34;real&#34; whereas multi-effects pedals are &#34;fake&#34;. This might be true to some extent, but modern digital modeling is getting so close to vintage analog signal chains... that at some point the trade-off does indeed make sense. (FYI: Dave Mustaine uses a DigiTech GSP1101 as part of his live rig). #endrant. Anyway, the Boss ME-70 has only a few settings useful onstage, but not so much for recording since in the end, they do sound a tad digital, and the ME-70 compresses your signal. The MXR Fullbore does not compress, and sounds analog, so it wins.FOR RECORDING PURPOSES? I bought this pedal because I wanted a dedicated metal distortion to use for my Metal EP I'm self-recording. In conjunction with an ADA GCS-3, I created an all-analog signal chain for direct interface that sounds amazing. Check out the ADA GCS-3 if you can. It's an amazing speaker simulator, and it can take any pedal you throw at it and convert it into a beautifully sounding emulation as if the pedal itself was it's own 1x12 combo amplifier. Anyway, through the GCS-3, the Fullbore basically sounds like a Mesa-Boogie.WHY ONLY 4 STARS? The Fullbore isn't for everybody, it isn't for every guitar, or every amp, but by itself, it's really friggin good. I suppose if it had a 10-band EQ and a 12AX7 preamp circuit, it would be &#34;the best metal pedal&#34;, but for a small piece of gear, it's probably the best analog distortion on the market.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bottom line front mxr fullbore metal high octane distortion suitable modern metal music band eq adjustable midrange q give mxr fm ability model virtually

{"reviewText":"Background:I'm a gear-head, with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well.  Before my current set-up, I played a Fender Strat run through my effects into a Vox AC15.  The Vox sounded great but I had two problems: 1 - The all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig. 2 - At 15 watts, even though it was loud, I'd often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band, and as the tube amp increased, so did it's natural gain.  That would normally be sweet, but it would color my effects with a different tone, and often times leave me having feedback issues.Enter the Fender Frontman 212R!This thing has TONS of clean headroom, and it seems like it was built for pedals.  I can crank the amp or keep it quiet, and there is no tone changes done to my effects.  This is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom.  It makes it easy to dial in your sound every time, no matter what volume you play at.Secondly, it's Fender reliable (with a 5 year warranty).  No tubes means no tube issues.  Yes, it doesn't sound as good as the Vox by itself, but that's why I have pedals.Other things worth mentioning:It's not as heavy as my Vox (all tube) amp.  I can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another.It's got 2x12inch speakers.  They push some serious sound, and they have some low punch too.  My Vox had a better speaker, but the 12 inch by itself would often get stressed at high volumes.  This amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down!My Vox may be a better recording amp, but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"background gear head affection pedal always looking amp take well current set played fender strat run effect vox ac vox sounded great two problem tube amp

{"reviewText":"Compared to the nickel wound XL light gauges I buy in the 3-set boxes, the \"balanced tension\" XL set amounts to slightly lighter D and A strings (.025/.026 and .034/.036 respectively, which I can feel, as well as a slightly thicker B string .0135/.013 which, frankly, I can't feel).The XLs are comparable in gauge to Ernie Ball Regular Slinky (yellow). But if you're used to Slinky's, as I was for many years, the nickel wounds feel noticeably coarser to the skin and took awhile to get used to. I love them now for blues, rock or funk, any kind of playing where you want to dig in a bit for tone - although I will say that for slide (especially when recording at relatively low volume) they don't give quite the same glassy-sounding undertone to my ears as steel wounds, something I happen to prefer.I put the XLs on an Squire Strat, which I like to bend strings on and the 5-position switch gives me a nice range of color to compare. Like the regular XLs, I noticed very little \"new string zing\" after giving them a good stretch. When my skin is dry indoors during the winter the nickels can feel rough at first but in warmer humid temps I sweat more and they get as slick as any steel wounds.I think the balanced tension is more a factor when playing chords than single lines and, for me, it's more of feel thing rather than something I hear (That doesn't make it any less significant to me - I've tossed brand new sets of strings and sold perfectly good guitars on the vague basis they didn't quite feel right).To tell the truth, when playing out I prefer an even heavier set than regular lights for tone, but at home when recording or just playing for myself I like the amount of resistance I get from the nickel wound XLs versus the Slinky's I used since I began playing as a kid. You have to work a little harder with the nickels for bends and intonation but I like the tone and feel overall and I think it's made me a more precise player.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"compared nickel wound xl light gauge buy set box balanced tension xl set amount slightly lighter string respectively feel well slightly thicker b string

{"reviewText":"Enjoyable mic, has a decent frequency response range, nice patterning to not pick up too much ambient room noise. I usually have to do some post-processing on vocals, but in the genres I work in that's not exactly a rare thing. Either way sounds way better than I would expect for a mic at this price. Haven't tried it for drums or guitar *yet* but I'm impressed with it's ability to accurately capture vocals. While it doesn't have the warmth that some mics relay, I prefer it that way.

This capo is beautiful,  It is clean with an even silver matte finish that looks good in the box (nice packaging) and equally good on the guitar.The capo is solid, the spring mechanism feels good in the hand and when it clamps down on the neck you can see (and hear) there was thought put into the capo to make sure the pressure on the string is even and the neck is well protected. No sharp points to damage the guitar.  And this thing is easy to use, squeeze, put on neck, done.  You could easily move this during a gig and then store it on the edge of your neck when not using it.  I tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both.  When playing the strings behave as normal.  No odd muting or dropouts.  The capo is solid on the neck.I have to say I have not used a capo in a while because the one I have is pain.

{"reviewText":"Firstly let me address the &#34;adjustable backrest&#34;. There's nothing adjustable about the backrest. The seat moves forward and backward about two inches which actually is a considerable difference in how it feels leaning back against the backrest but the backrest itself doesn't move, the seat does. It also does not adjust up and down as you would think an &#34;adjustable&#34; backrest should. The backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this. But the seat does adjust slightly forward and back (presumably this is the purported backrest adjustment the description repeatedly asserts) and it does adjust up and down over quite a range so adjusting for height should not be a problem. The footrest, however, is welded in place so if you plan to use the footrest you're again limited to where you can put the seat in height range.All this aside I am still giving the stool high marks because it's a fair price, it does fold down with some extra dis-assembly for transport to venues and I find it works well for me. But for how it works for me you should know: I wanted this initially to play sitting down without a strap. I found that no matter how I adjusted the stool that I was just not comfortable with how the guitar rested and so I use it now exclusively with a strap. In this way however it's actually really nice because I can use the footrest or not at will and I can also stand up, walk around and then sit back down at will. Without the strap, though, my playing dexterity is compromised by slight balancing required to keep the guitar from smashing to the floor (at least in my mind's eye).If you want a stool that folds up and goes with you this is not that stool. You do need to loosen the screws and take the seat post out and remove the backrest. Then you're left with several pieces to schlep. Not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day.Overall though I am very happy with the way this stool feels. No more couch and kitchen chairs for me.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"firstly let address adjustable backrest nothing adjustable backrest seat move forward backward two inch actually

{"reviewText":"For me, the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used.It's not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down. In many cases, they jump around until, by the time they settle down, the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers. So, a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved.As far as the SN-8 is concerned...WRONG!I've found the SN-8 to, in fact, be Super Tight, BUT one has to insure that there isn't even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar.This is what I don't like about the other type of Snark display.  It's not symmetric!  It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green, and none of the yellow bars to be lit.  If the rad bars are illuminated constantly, how can you tell if the string is a hair flat?  When I'm on pitch I want *all* indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish.In that regard, the image shown here is wrong! It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow. Uhm...no.The SN-8 is Super Tight, has a touch metronome, and lets you set it down a few semi-tones if that's what floats your boat and, as they say on TV, \"All for an incredibly low price!\"I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case.

{"reviewText":"Great clone of a much more expensive Crunch Box pedal.  True bypass.  Knobs and switch are sturdy.  Great for amps that have only a master volume and no gain knob because you can dial in the dirt at bedroom levels.  This is a Marshall type distortion (more mids, less scooped).  No Brutalzzz - there are better pedals to cop the scooped 5150 or triple rectofier kachunky palm muting downtuned type thing, but you can get close with the right amp EQ and this thing dimed.  I agree with another reviewer- this thing has a very high output- so be forewarned the first time you plug in.  Unity is around 8 o'clock on the level knob.  It gets thumbs up for the sound/price ratio.  If you don't mind a longer shipping time, these pedals can be found more cheaply by searching the web.

{"reviewText":"Great overdrive/distortion for classic rock music.  Good volume roll off tones , at full bore it sounds like VH, and some other 80s rock dudes. It's quiet and has a very active tone control. The crunch switch adds a touch of high end harmonic , not too much but just enough. MXR has come around to making pedals that do what they say they will do. I now own  a Script Phase 90, and a Micro Chorus as well and plan on getting others.

{"reviewText":"Had it for about two weeks and I'm about to return it now.Things that I like(d):1. It's a classic Fender and I was looking for something of good quality with great price.2. Sounds clear and crystal good, unplugged.3. This can be subjective but I think this BulletStrat is more comfortable than a Les Paul simply because it's wider and thinner.4. All the previous four ratings here on Amazon and even higher ratings on Musician's friend.Things I don't like much:1. 15th fret of lower E string is dead, and like always I take quality control into my rating account.(I don't want to bother go to a local shop for a fix, never mention that's $20 in addition)2. I couldn't figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound (like not a bit)? (I'm new to electric but my Les Paul does change tunes... in a much much more obvious way)3. Talking about plugged sound, it's no where close to unplugged. Notes are pretty mixed up and not separated/clear, very loud though.4. I don't know if it's universal, I ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches. What's worse is, they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove... (I', not even sure if I can call it a protective cover because it's pretty weak and thin.)This is overall an OK guitar, consider its price it can be made at least slightly better. For beginners on budget with less than $200, I would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price. For example, me, I got a SX Deimos ($175) Les Paul which I'm in love with now. Simply everything about it is better, and I finally get the feelings of an electric. I'm glad I don't need to stuck with this anymore.According to Amazon,3 Stars - It's OK4 Stars - I like it5 Stars - I love it3 Stars Checked, it really IS just an OKAY guitar to me.Thanks for reading, and hope people find their beloved guitars!","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"two week return thing like classic fender looking something good quality great price sound clear crystal good

That being said, This is the most user friendly little tuner I have ever owned. I don't have a particularly good ear, but I can tell when I am out of tune, and I have struggled with other tuners in the past trying to get just the right tune. I bought this for a brand new backpack guitar, and I had the guitar tuned up in less than 5 minutes after I clamped this tuner on the neck.

{"reviewText":"I am but a mere novice when it comes to playing the guitar, but I purchased this SN-1 to replace the piece of junk first tuner I had. I'm very happy with the size of the SN-1. It's small, much smaller than I expected which was a big bonus. It takes up very little room on the headstock, and does not interfere when I make tuning adjustments. The &#34;chip-clip&#34; style clamp does a surprisingly good job of staying in place on my Ibanez acoustic and I *think* my guitar sounds better than it did while using my previous tuner.The user interface is very simple, and the display is easy to read and understand in both higher and lower lighting conditions. The instruction manual is adequate, but the SN-1 seemed very intuitive for me to use. The product arrived on time, as shown, well packaged, for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change. I've had this SN-1 for a couple months now, and will update this review down the road. Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will do the best I can to answer.SPO","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"mere novice come playing guitar purchased sn

{"reviewText":"I bought one of these for myself after using one in a junior high school music program. (I'm a teacher, not a student.) I have only used it with Garage Band, but it works really well. I have used it to record electronic drums, bass guitar (direct out from a multi-effects pedal), vocals, and guitar (with garage band's virtual amps.) I've been very impressed. If you really turn up the gain, you will start to get a lot of noise, but the noise comes well AFTER you get past the point that any reasonable signal is &#34;clipping&#34;-making the light turn red. So, with the gain at 1/3 or so of the way up, you get good clean signal with little to no noise. The cord connecting to the ipad is really pathetically short. I bought 2 of the same Ziotek extension cable-at the recommendation of Focusrite. One worked, the other didn't. So, yeah, best of luck with that. Focusrite should really have made a longer cable. It gets in the way of the USB power plug a little bit, and makes things awkward.

{"reviewText":"I bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic. Learned my lesson. Should of just forked over the money for an a/e. I have a Yamaha F335 I really like. I say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so I thought I'd try it. I first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented. I like it, sounded good then I saw this from Axl and I thought I'd try it. Installing it wasn't bad except I bought a set of drill bits I didn't need for $10. So I got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright. I just wanted it for playing around at home so I didn't need real great sound quality.

But objectively, when compared to an Epiphone 335-style case I bought last year for $81, it's deserving of 4 stars (which isn't bad, just not great):PROS:  Decent build quality; four buckles (one locking) and three hinges; very nice plush lining; not heavy; knobs on bottom so it stands on end; knobs on side and back so it's never directly on the floor; fits a dreadnaught well.CONS:  Not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut; the one locking buckle wouldn't stop anyone; the big front and back body panels flex more than they should; exterior covering feels somewhat cheap; the handle is hard plastic and not padded.So for $40 it's a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard, but it doesn't measure up to a basic Epi 335 case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes.  It also had a strong chemical odor, but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought recently replace old cardboard case acoustic

It will turn itself off in one minute if you stop playing, but I usually start right into playing after tuning. The only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life. This is a great little tuner and I am glad I bought it.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"bought two buck work great acoustic electric guitar easy see center quickly tuning without drifting place thing would improve add button button tuner stay long plucking strumming string turn one minute stop playing usually start right playing tuning reason turn would conserve battery life great little tuner glad bought","words":["bought","two","buck","work","great","acoustic","electric","guitar","easy","see","center","quickly","tuning","without","drifting","place","thing","would","improve","add","button","button","tuner","stay","long","plucking","strumming","string","turn","one","minute","stop","playing","usually","start","right","playing","tuning","reason","turn","would","conserve","battery","life","great","little","tuner","glad","bought"],"filtered_words":["bought","two","buck","work","great","acoustic","electric","guitar","easy","see","center","quickly","tuning","without","drifting","place","thing","improve","add","button","button","tuner","stay","long","plucking","strumming","string","turn","one","minute","stop","playing","usually","start","right","playing","tuning","reason","turn","conserve","battery","life","great","little","tuner","glad","bought"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[89,354,433,750,760,796,815,1390,1480,1590,1728,1790,1799,2408,2590,2665,2834,2944,2968,2990,2996,3318,3357,3391,3477,3635,3815,3857,3886,3904,4043,4150,4193,4527,4646,4728,4781,4803,4887,4897],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[89,354,433,750,760,796,815,1390,1480,1590,1728,1790,1799,2408,2590,2665,2834,2944,2968,2990,2996,3318,3357,3391,3477,3635,3815,3857,3886,3904,4043,4150,4193,4527,4646,4728,4781,4803,4887,4897],"values":[4.793453186546135,2.7244577018571823,3.2497510262174725,2.4018482407144863,2.0808067296051758,4.535722665709494,1.1804105805241405,3.2224878754591084,2.9671067477956488,1.653464542587499,7.290432101982107,2.4150955592454455,6.402989687445694,5.125329167328599,2.801656512714457,4.100404594451648,4.238990757737795,3.6452160509910536,2.4064092939894848,3.9180830376576936,3.8609246238177453,3.656473205515688,4.054419481209825,3.7067739439904868,3.7639323578304356,2.8594760836032833,7.62676511906781,2.152815183876615,6.756539754036901,2.5354719219540995,2.5232468308248404,7.444443562273855,6.32631699480301,1.3452463153629912,4.220231516405571,2.5342426654993697,4.166302793128859,1.0350913870591516,3.3119472340873783,1.583182617697721]}}

{"reviewText":"I couldn't believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price. Especially given what I paid for it, this case is unbelievable... velvety cushioning inside, heavy-duty outside, and a little compartment for picks or capos (I can't fit much else in there but I don't really need to). A few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze -- at first, I didn't think my Ibanez mandolin fit in here, but when I finally applied some pressure, it went right in. Now that I've been using the case for a while it seems broken in, and I don't have to fight it so much to get it to close.The only downside is that after a few uses, the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge. I used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it's on the bottom, it's not very noticeable, but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through. I didn't take a star away for that as it's purely cosmetic, and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin, I can forgive some tape on the edge. In this case, I still got more than my money's worth.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"believe hardshell mandolin case even existed price especially given paid case unbelievable velvety cushioning inside heavy duty outside little compartment pick capo fit much else really need reviewer mentioned squeeze first think ibanez mandolin fit finally applied pressure went right using case seems broken fight much get close downside us outer black layer case started peeling edge used electrical tape stick back since bottom noticeable one place low price kind showed take star away purely cosmetic long thing protecting mandolin forgive tape edge case still got money worth","words":["believe","hardshell","mandolin","case","even","existed","price","especially","given","paid","case","unbelievable","velvety","cushioning","inside","heavy","duty","outside","little","compartment","pick","capo","fit","much","else","really","need","reviewer","mentioned","squeeze","first","think","ibanez","mandolin","fit","finally","applied","pressure","went","right","using","case","seems","broken","fight","much","get","close","downside","us","outer","black","layer","case","started","peeling","edge","used","electrical","tape","stick","back","since","bottom","noticeable","one","place","low","price","kind","showed","take","star","away","purely","cosmetic","long","thing","protecting","mandolin","forgive","tape","edge","case","still","got","money","worth"],"filtered_words":["believe","hardshell","mandolin","case","even","existed","price","especially","given","paid","case","unbelievable","velvety","cushioning","inside","heavy","duty","outside","little","compartment","pick","capo","fit","much","else","really","need","reviewer","mentioned","squeeze","first","think","ibanez","mandolin","fit","finally","applied","pressure","went","right","using","case","seems","broken","fight","much","get","close","downside","us","outer","black","layer","case","started","peeling","edge","used","electrical","tape","stick","back","since","bottom","noticeable","one","place","low","price","kind","showed","take","star","away","purely","cosmetic","long","thing","protecting","mandolin","forgive","tape","edge","case","still","got","money","worth"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[34,55,96,170,229,524,533,578,661,815,855,960,1010,1044,1045,1103,1173,1287,1342,1390,1394,1403,1406,1537,1590,1660,1736,1738,1790,1817,1820,1929,1948,1981,2006,2256,2335,2372,2526,2545,2566,2569,2696,3173,3205,3303,3348,3411,3430,3497,3568,3619,3656,3712,3737,3753,3831,3857,3904,3921,3927,3936,3949,4066,4112,4152,4211,4293,4354,4363,4371,4426,4605,4679,4797,4847],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[34,55,96,170,229,524,533,578,661,815,855,960,1010,1044,1045,1103,1173,1287,1342,1390,1394,1403,1406,1537,1590,1660,1736,1738,1790,1817,1820,1929,1948,1981,2006,2256,2335,2372,2526,2545,2566,2569,2696,3173,3205,3303,3348,3411,3430,3497,3568,3619,3656,3712,3737,3753,3831,3857,3904,3921,3927,3936,3949,4066,4112,4152,4211,4293,4354,4363,4371,4426,4605,4679,4797,4847],"values":[3.5061032485283357,3.174746112573893,4.703603538348654,3.0377243150096023,7.038978454165691,3.68096284579973,3.999761068671961,5.572641385372264,4.682326139901369,2.360821161048281,2.6514116391161937,2.164629667290378,2.3723996400489558,3.4340846561248473,6.597145701886651,2.9172349177554757,5.4295405417315905,2.827674240442412,13.454266855837451,3.2224878754591084,5.031510412110944,2.494502336849856,2.1149505782573685,1.9792003244098373,1.653464542587499,4.112239052098651,5.304377398777584,3.352245132960166,2.4150955592454455,4.060053298928081,6.191680593778488,4.301729098371219,3.722774285336928,3.407257413891703,11.610681049440176,9.495133323539541,2.608161655322377,2.2551972907801803,6.017327206633709,3.364085242026494,6.597145701886651,3.003755014951387,6.191680593778488,3.1269554487375446,7.849908670382019,3.9328981234428344,5.015148836834417,2.6780052286896416,2.48510156256515,3.6640489993241454,4.781855735248402,2.8594760836032833,5.835005649839755,2.4194671509069416,3.172417822814302,4.301729098371219,4.218923194686986,2.152815183876615,2.5354719219540995,8.914159076780761,6.191680593778488,6.751296381713909,3.0813449374854924,3.70281354277439,1.786705026119061,4.535722665709494,5.940366165497581,4.6112302182176395,4.7475666617697705,5.903998521326706,3.82455697964687,1.548205865108894,1.9624167136570156,2.9595595421602656,4.631032845513819,4.424018676129493]}}

{"reviewText":"I got this for one of my guitar students whose mom just wanted a cheap case for her acoustic guitar.  Now, let's be clear - this is easily worth $16, but it is a very bare-bones gig bag.  It will protect your instrument to a degree - it only has minimal padding - and is probably good enough for any beginner instrument.  ONe of my students has one of those Esteban infomercial guitars, which is pretty low quality (but not terrible and not unplayable), and the gig bag for that instrument has no padding whatsoever.I only give 3 stars because for a little more money it's possible to get something which I feel is noticably better.  I have a Musician's Friend acoustic gig bag that I paid ~$20 for a few years ago, and it's well made and probably has twice the padding of this thing.So, this isn't bad, it's worth the price, it's put together just fine, but it only just barely serves its purpose of protecting your instrument, and I'd never trust this with an instrument of any value.  Gig bags can be a good alternative to a hard case if space or weight are a concern.  This isnt' a bad choice, but just be aware of what you're getting.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"got one guitar student whose mom wanted cheap case acoustic guitar let clear easily worth bare

{"reviewText":"I got this on sale from GC for $80 shipped (plus $7 tax arrrgh). First and foremost this amp is AMAZING.  All the hype and positive reviews you read are all true.  My playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs (lol) and this amp does it all.  The tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just can't be described, they have to be heard.  The modulations, and del/reverbs are well done also.  There are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the Fuse software (or taken out completely).  All the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust, and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good (even with my substandard playing ability!  Both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp.  The tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use.  Headphones work well also.  About my only real complaints are so minor- no place to store the Power cord or USB cord (included!).  Printed documentation is pretty lame but the included DVD is more through.  The Fuse software has to be downloaded and as I have limited online speed this took over an hour.  The headphone jack is a 3.5mm and most good headphones are still using the 1/4\".  Not a big deal but the 3.5mm to 1/4\" adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy.  The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down.  No corner protectors on this.  All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you $1000's of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"got sale gc

I don't have to worry anymore about my iPad falling off of the stand.  Some people have said that it's not as safe when you rotate it to the portrait position.  I have not found that to be true.  Since I've had the stand, I have never droped the iPad out of it.  A lot of the other clips clamp on to the stand with the mic.  Because of the way that I stand with my guitar, it's hard for me to see the thing when I use the clamp kind.  This one uses the Mic clip treads and because it's on it's own stand, I can put it anywhere, at any height and see the iPad.  The only drawback is, you can't have your iPad in a case.  Or you have to find a case that's ultra thin.

After using it to tune 10 different prospects in a row, I decided to buy one on the spot (the tuner that is, it took another hour to decide on a guitar).It is very easy to use, the tuning via vibration is spectacular in a noisy environment. I like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if there's a drop-D song, or just tweak something that goes out of tune.Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it stays out of the way.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"used one guitar shop shopping new acoustic electric used big klunky one balance leg trying tune idea even existed using tune different prospect row decided buy one spot tuner took another hour decide guitar easy use tuning via vibration spectacular noisy environment like leaving guitar practicing make minor adjustment drop song tweak something go tune exactly supposed stay way","words":["used","one","guitar","shop","shopping","new","acoustic","electric","used","big","klunky","one","balance","leg","trying","tune","idea","even","existed","using","tune","different","prospect","row","decided","buy","one","spot","tuner","took","another","hour","decide","guitar","easy","use","tuning","via","vibration","spectacular","noisy","environment","like","leaving","guitar","practicing","make","minor","adjustment","drop","song","tweak","something","go","tune","exactly","supposed","stay","way"],"filtered_words":["used","one","guitar","shop","shopping","new","acoustic","electric","used","big","klunky","one","balance","leg","trying","tune","idea","even","existed","using","tune","different","prospect","row","decided","buy","one","spot","tuner","took","another","hour","decide","guitar","easy","use","tuning","via","vibration","spectacular","noisy","environment","like","leaving","guitar","practicing","make","minor","adjustment","drop","song","tweak","something","go","tune","exactly","supposed","stay","way"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[80,89,133,196,312,433,527,585,602,619,760,815,958,960,1226,1290,1406,1451,1586,1683,1703,1736,1993,2022,2071,2096,2334,2350,2368,2392,2407,2457,2590,2753,2777,2968,3048,3166,3293,3300,3330,3427,3525,3577,3581,3803,3824,4193,4391,4605,4803,4826],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[80,89,133,196,312,433,527,585,602,619,760,815,958,960,1226,1290,1406,1451,1586,1683,1703,1736,1993,2022,2071,2096,2334,2350,2368,2392,2407,2457,2590,2753,2777,2968,3048,3166,3293,3300,3330,3427,3525,3577,3581,3803,3824,4193,4391,4605,4803,4826],"values":[2.197419490113369,2.3967265932730677,1.3296557991338742,3.1841138625774934,3.999761068671961,3.2497510262174725,3.755564108159919,2.6363325322890736,5.0020965269046505,3.62307492511384,2.0808067296051758,3.5412317415724215,3.9279353341007055,2.164629667290378,3.4804608179149983,4.945743590353519,2.1149505782573685,2.21422660842975,4.225567737405655,2.689417620741386,3.7639323578304356,5.304377398777584,4.517704160206816,3.4102029241214598,3.893868779537099,3.4899998409617567,4.407889294199609,2.655563894216961,8.532857754327924,4.179957226153602,5.19315176366736,4.021267273892924,2.801656512714457,5.0020965269046505,5.835005649839755,2.4064092939894848,3.122520851669679,2.648653016677114,5.5986168717755245,4.015847206423585,1.2895854682574375,4.440412485905169,1.974977939529989,3.8609246238177453,5.940366165497581,4.703603538348654,4.0432461806117,3.163158497401505,2.3415329920684287,3.9248334273140313,3.105274161177455,2.801656512714457]}}

{"reviewText":"I have owned almost every octave/harmonizer/pitch shifter on the market. For what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of, you cant beat it. First off, Its polyphonic. You wont find that in anything else under $300. Instant tracking, wide range of versatility, perfect volume balancing and very solid design. Only two flaws: a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals, still doesnt hum as bad as my POG did. The only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode. Its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day. Otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam.

{"reviewText":"I have run sound for several large churches, providing services for both live sound and television broadcasting. The way that you have to mix for each of those is vastly different, especially when applying vocal effects. I have also run a small recording studio for the last 12 years.The 80/20 rule says that if you can get 80% of the sound you're looking for with 20% of the work, be satisfied. This Mic Mechanic (MM) is more like 99% of the sound with 1% of the work.I actually use this more in a studio setting than for live sound. Primarily because it solves SO many problems that you face as a sound engineer.1) Adaptive tone. The MM continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression, gate, EQ, and de-essing. Even when recording dry vocals, at a minimum, you should at least set your compression, then in post production, add parametric EQ to place your vocals where they need to be set.Now? I hit the tone button, and all that is done for me. It makes a dynamic mic sound great! It makes working with a condenser mic easier.2) Reverb. Most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb. They either use too much or too little. With this, when you it equally between wet and dry, you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life. I recorded a vocal with club, room, and hall reverb. Each one sat just right! When you solo the vocals, you can tell which is used. In the mix it was more subtle. Good Job!3) Pitch correction. I have to admit, my own vocals aren't perfect. When you record your own vocals, and you're like me, you'll hear a \"chorus\" sound in your headphones. That's because you're hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones. This takes a second to get use to.When set in the center, you can still do your vocal gymnastics, slide into notes, and it seems... natural. It pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale, so if you're way off, it will make your vocals sound out.I'm not a singer, but this has renewed my joy in singing!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"run sound several large church providing service live sound television broadcasting way mix vastly different especially applying vocal effect also run

{"reviewText":"I have spent a good month with my new guitar, and I am impressed. The pickups don't suck, the potentiometers are surprisingly good, the tuners are not very good, but I can live with them. The fretwork was second to none, absolutely the best fretwork I've seen in a guitar under $500. The 60's neck profile is very fast and comfortable, and it's a satin finished neck and body (unfinished fretboard). It's also not a very heavy guitar (considering that it's a mahogany body and neck). My main issue with this guitar is that the wraparound bridge/tailpiece breaks wound strings easily. I have gone through 4 6th, and 2 5th strings in the single month I have owned this guitar. Upgrade it to something better. Your strings will thank you.

{"reviewText":"I have two delay pedals, both inexpensive (this one and a Behringer) and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap Behringer, the Danelectro sounds more natural.  The Behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal, which is perfectly ok for some applications.  The Danelectro has a warmer, almost analog feel.  It sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos.  The case is plastic but unless you eat 3 times your weight at the Golden Corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet, you're not going to break it.  The only thing I don't like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it.  I suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the \"retro\" look of this pedal.  Ok, fine.  I've heard pedals costing twice as much that don't sound as nice as this one.  As one reviewer once wrote, there are guitarists who would rather catch AIDS than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board; I, however, think some of these cheap pedals function quite well, and in some cases, just as well as their more expensive counterparts.  If you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your Holy Grail, OCD, and other \"boutique\" pedals, I promise the other ones won't catch AIDS from this.  In fact, the whole ensemble will benefit.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"two delay pedal inexpensive one behringer although one even cheaper already cheap behringer danelectro sound natural

{"reviewText":"I initially wanted a Yamaha Pacifica 012DLX - Guitar Center in Eugene claimed to have stock in website - but when I reached there - there wasn't any. So I tested an Affinity and a Bullet HSS instead - and thought the Bullet was pretty ok - but they did not have the color I wanted. So I ordered through Amazon - but I bought a microcube from Guitar Center as I'm greatful for the opportunity to test guitars.I waited for 2 weeks before I make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression.I received the guitar in perfect condition - it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors. Just a few words SQUIER by Fender. New strings and scratch free. Made in China it says. However - it did not have sharp frets like I experience with some 100 bucks guitarsThe action came very high and I had intended to return it - but the guitar was perfect and I couldn't find any fault to return. So I proceed to setup the guitar through 3 long and painful steps: 1)Straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod. 2)Then measured the string action height and set it from 1.5mm for the first 3 strings and 2mm for the last 3 strings. 3)Setup the intonation using a tuner. You really need a tuner for this step.After that, the guitar was splendid. It did go out of tune in 2 or 3 days but stabilized after that. I do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning.After 2 weeks, I'm still loving the guitar. Beginners be warned - you may like the action or may need to do setup like I did. In fact I'm so impressed with Squier that I'm thinking of getting the Squier Standard Strat next - pretty curious of the Alnico pups.Latest review:Downgraded from 5 to 3 stars.I bought a Washburn RX40 with Duncan USM.The bullet is nice but I outgrew it.The tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive.The bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings, Tusq nut, locking the trem down.. etc.I'd recommend to save some money and buy something above $200. Guitars at that price may be twice the cost,.. but is more than twice better.The 2 important things are not in Bullet: the sustain and the sound.Latest review:The product is back at 5 stars!I got the sustain to improve by increasing the action.Fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short.There some sounds that a Strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short...like attack finger plucking.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"initially wanted yamaha pacifica dlx guitar center eugene claimed stock website reached tested affinity bullet hs instead thought bullet pretty ok

{"reviewText":"I love my MXL 2010 microphone for its versatility, warmth in capturing the voice, and build quality. Most reviews I've read of MXL microphones have always emphasized it's clear and warm qualities it brings in our voices and instruments. The MXL Studio 24 aims at the consumer whom seeks a high quality condenser microphone without the usb interface. It keeps recording equipment minimal, literally connecting just through the usb cable. In short, the MXL Studio 24 has an excellent build (stand & microphone), easy to use software, and clear recording capabilities.Features:1) 22mm Condenser Capsule (not very big, but will suit most people)2) Cardioid pattern (I recommend also looking at microphones with figure 8 and omnidirectional patterns if those suit your needs better)3) Zero Latency monitoring (a bonus feature that not all condenser microphones have)4) Frequency response 20 Hz - 20 kHz (My MXL 2010 has a 30Hz - 20kHz. The 30hz merely means it can capture even more lowest lows)5) Output 1/8\" headphone jack, USB audio6) High pass filter 120Hz, 235Hz, 465Hz (software controlled)7) Lightweight 340gThoughts- Very impressive build. It's built like a rock & has a very fine finish. The grill and the frame around the grill are solid. I was surprised at how heavy the base was. It has a flat cone shape and definitely keeps the microphone in place. It's not some cheap plastic.- The recording capability is parallel to my experience with myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Mic. The clarity and power isn't nearly as good as the MXL 2010, but is certainly close. Using an USB interface, a condenser microphone gets more power and you are able to tweak the settings a bit more. With USB, it's a bit more set for you, but that may suit some people perfectly. If you want minimal tweaks out of the box with some occasional tweaks later with the software, this is a solid option.- Easy to use. Plug it in via USB and you literally on your way. The software installation is optional. The microphone works without it. Windows 7 64 bit detected this microphone with no hiccups.SummaryThe MXL Studio 24 USB microphone is aimed at users whom seek higher quality recording with an excellent build. There are certainly cheaper USB condenser microphones, but not many compare to the build and durability of MXL products like this one. To me, the fairly luxurious price of the MXL 24 is justified with it's excellent build, clear recording, and the ease of use. If you're not too sure about getting this USB condenser microphone or any USB microphone for that matter, I recommend getting a condenser microphone (non-USB) and plugging that in via USB interface. If you need any guidance at all with that process, I'm more than willing to help out.

It has a nice rubber padding so I trust putting my instrument on it. I have a Tenor Ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand. It is very lightweight which is also a plus. I use the stand at home too. I stand my ukulele on it because sometimes I play and then I want to go to YouTube to listen to a particular song. It is very convenient.

{"reviewText":"I love the freedom the G30 gives me. I'm a real klutz with my cords...especially on the ML designed guitars. So I figured this product would actually end up saving me money over the longrun. The sound is a lot more, there.

It is *very well padded* for a gig bag, having extra padding at the base of the instrument (where the bottom strap button would be if you have one) to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end.  It also has a nicely padded handle.  I received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well.  (Ukulele not included.

{"reviewText":"I own Dunlop, Kyser and G7th Nashville Capos.  I don't like the direction the Dunlop faces, it seems awkward.  The Kyser spring is very poplar, but I think the spring tension is too strong, making it harder to take on and off and I think it makes the strings a little sharp.  I like the G7th Nashville Capo, but the spring tension is inconsistent.  The used to be softer, maybe too soft, but the lastone I bought was almost as still as the Nashfille.  Ths Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is similar to the Kyser and Nashville Capos, but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations. Only downside is I think the Nashville capo looks better.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"dunlop kyser g th nashville capo like direction dunlop face seems awkward kyser spring poplar think spring tension strong making harder take think make string little sharp like g th nashville capo spring tension inconsistent used softer maybe soft lastone bought almost still nashfille th planet wave n artist capo similar kyser nashville capo tension adjustable seems best combination downside think nashville capo look better","words":["dunlop","kyser","g","th","nashville","capo","like","direction","dunlop","face","seems","awkward","kyser","spring","poplar","think","spring","tension","strong","making","harder","take","think","make","string","little","sharp","like","g","th","nashville","capo","spring","tension","inconsistent","used","softer","maybe","soft","lastone","bought","almost","still","nashfille","th","planet","wave","n","artist","capo","similar","kyser","nashville","capo","tension","adjustable","seems","best","combination","downside","think","nashville","capo","look","better"],"filtered_words":["dunlop","kyser","g","th","nashville","capo","like","direction","dunlop","face","seems","awkward","kyser","spring","poplar","think","spring","tension","strong","making","harder","take","think","make","string","little","sharp","like","g","th","nashville","capo","spring","tension","inconsistent","used","softer","maybe","soft","lastone","bought","almost","still","nashfille","th","planet","wave","n","artist","capo","similar","kyser","nashville","capo","tension","adjustable","seems","best","combination","downside","think","nashville","capo","look","better"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[96,740,763,855,1000,1355,1590,1644,1861,1881,1981,2046,2061,2335,2479,2507,2543,2545,2618,2719,2979,3330,3415,3525,3554,3566,3619,3712,3916,3931,4034,4045,4099,4130,4597,4605,4646,4777,4818,4897,4939,4960,4999],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[96,740,763,855,1000,1355,1590,1644,1861,1881,1981,2046,2061,2335,2479,2507,2543,2545,2618,2719,2979,3330,3415,3525,3554,3566,3619,3712,3916,3931,4034,4045,4099,4130,4597,4605,4646,4777,4818,4897,4939,4960,4999],"values":[4.703603538348654,4.572763937389843,2.4804341095176548,2.6514116391161937,10.709329030168433,3.7937853209801164,1.653464542587499,12.445820088808578,8.543055850941965,3.942898206777418,17.036287069458517,20.160981722125577,3.7597394795703996,7.824484965967132,3.903484238236541,5.304377398777584,2.0063642533506596,3.364085242026494,7.62676511906781,7.312946411031376,6.80278458887861,2.579170936514875,5.498533413218542,1.974977939529989,4.805386232658597,3.2151796821523835,5.718952167206567,2.4194671509069416,6.1007088155727605,4.376390627140238,4.841753876829471,4.316222105673785,3.419091871538706,4.399921124550432,4.071417057578396,1.9624167136570156,2.1101157582027854,5.344382733391283,3.576720815742289,1.583182617697721,2.2959805623822716,13.553112480620449,15.527280062866474]}}

{"reviewText":"I own the older Color Bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one. I love the size, weight and LED bulbs on this one though. It has a nice color throw too. It also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but........this new LED version is built with less quality. When you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings, the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one, about every second. They do not stop flashing when it's plugged in since it don't have an on/off switch. If you are using this on a switcher, then it wouldn't be a problem.I'd prefer the light to stop when the music stops, but it don't. When you try to adjust the audio flashing, it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation.Also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by 4 plastic pegs sticking through the back. They will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around. Within 1 hour of getting it, I had to take it apart, push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in place.I love the light but it's not as useful to me since it's \"always\" flashing. It's possible I have a defective one, not sure.The cool bright LED bulbs are the best part of this light.***UPDATE,  I played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better. When you turn it all the down, the lights stopped flashing until the music started again. The one I have never stops flashing, even when the music stops.

{"reviewText":"I play in our band at church and as such, I've been wanting a Vox AC15 for quite some time.  For those of you who do not play contemporary Christian music and are wondering what the heck I'm talking about, let's just say that it's an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music, you must utilize a Vox tone.  Because of U2.  I know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for it.Anyway, for the past few years I've been utilizing a Line 6 Floor POD Plus to achieve this tone.  I've been using the \"Class A\" sound, which is close, and quite useable, but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and I've never found a way around that.  I just sort of dealt with it.  Then came Father's Day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used Vox AC15C1 and I love everything about it.  Doing a little research, it seems that its predecessor (AC15CC1) was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners.  Well, the AC15C1 implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp that's awesome right out of the box.  I've seen some people complain about the fact that it's a PCB inside and not hand-wired, and that it's made in China.  So what.  It sounds very nice, especially for the low price.The amp's overdrive is very rich, with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume.  I cranked it to 10 in my living room and was quire loud for a 15W amp, but not window-shattering loud.  In a church setting this is obviously not an option.  Fortunately, you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy Vox tone, just at a more manageable level.  You need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the \"Top Boost\" and \"Normal\" channels.  I've opted to just use the \"Normal\" channel and push it with a Joyo Ultimate Drive pedal, which by the way, is the most impressive $40 overdrive pedal you'll ever hear.  That overdrive does not interfere with the Vox tone at all.  I used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with DiMarzio HS series pickups and the Joyo pedal pushing the amp, and it was classic Vox chime all the way.  I also used a Boss DD-5 delay (also required if you play in a Christian band - same reason as the other thing I mentioned...)  Pure tone heaven.Some have noted noise or \"hiss\" problems with this amp, which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes.  Mine did not have this problem.  Actually, I thought it did, and I was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before I realized that it was the way I had the amp set up:  As I stated earlier, this is a 2-channel amp (Normal and Top Boost), but which one you're using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into.  I was plugged into the Normal channel, and didn't realize that the Top Boost volume was dimed and that's where the hiss was coming from.  I just shut that volume completely off since I was not using the Top Boost channel anyway.  Problem solved.I'm amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice.  I've owned Marshalls, MESA/Boogies, a Laney, a Music Man, and other oddball tube amps over the years, some costing several times the cost of the Vox AC15C1 and the Vox can hold its own with those others.  Think of it as an affordable \"boutique amp\".  If you can pick one up used like I did, all the better.

We've recorded whole ensemble practice sessions with the mic which it's really not designed for and still had reasonable results. Our friends who are musicians ( and even an audio engineer) are quite surprised and impressed with the quality of sound we get.I've even ordered a second mic for my computer to use with skype.To sum it up, this mic is cheap, easy to use, portable and with fidelity that will surprise you but don't expect it to be a full home recording studio :)","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"purchased one month ago partner musician recording equipment house really expect much except quick way record idea simple easy use outstanding quality sound used record acoustic guitar vocal surprisingly good fidelity recorded whole ensemble practice session mic really designed still reasonable result friend musician even audio engineer quite surprised impressed quality sound get even ordered second mic computer use skype sum mic cheap easy use portable fidelity surprise expect full home recording studio","words":["purchased","one","month","ago","partner","musician","recording","equipment","house","really","expect","much","except","quick","way","record","idea","simple","easy","use","outstanding","quality","sound","used","record","acoustic","guitar","vocal","surprisingly","good","fidelity","recorded","whole","ensemble","practice","session","mic","really","designed","still","reasonable","result","friend","musician","even","audio","engineer","quite","surprised","impressed","quality","sound","get","even","ordered","second","mic","computer","use","skype","sum","mic","cheap","easy","use","portable","fidelity","surprise","expect","full","home","recording","studio"],"filtered_words":["purchased","one","month","ago","partner","musician","recording","equipment","house","really","expect","much","except","quick","way","record","idea","simple","easy","use","outstanding","quality","sound","used","record","acoustic","guitar","vocal","surprisingly","good","fidelity","recorded","whole","ensemble","practice","session","mic","really","designed","still","reasonable","result","friend","musician","even","audio","engineer","quite","surprised","impressed","quality","sound","get","even","ordered","second","mic","computer","use","skype","sum","mic","cheap","easy","use","portable","fidelity","surprise","expect","full","home","recording","studio"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[116,133,306,373,385,399,402,488,519,524,627,724,741,760,815,836,958,1056,1166,1168,1406,1523,1649,1896,2620,2692,2739,2913,2923,2933,2968,3082,3139,3151,3365,3506,3551,3638,3691,3693,3712,3745,3758,3889,3897,4055,4086,4112,4256,4280,4347,4391,4426,4465,4485,4556,4605,4803,4868],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[116,133,306,373,385,399,402,488,519,524,627,724,741,760,815,836,958,1056,1166,1168,1406,1523,1649,1896,2620,2692,2739,2913,2923,2933,2968,3082,3139,3151,3365,3506,3551,3638,3691,3693,3712,3745,3758,3889,3897,4055,4086,4112,4256,4280,4347,4391,4426,4465,4485,4556,4605,4803,4868],"values":[6.751296381713909,3.9889673974016224,3.9632034729381633,7.90084541793772,5.031510412110944,4.192777914582663,3.237266469555227,3.6988687644833735,7.494530610690448,1.840481422899865,4.0432461806117,6.4636143092621285,3.4102029241214598,4.1616134592103515,1.1804105805241405,4.384172767582293,3.9279353341007055,3.0749957098068337,2.713823092839279,1.3002579281482092,4.229901156514737,4.238990757737795,3.833525649629631,3.7808819161442084,4.154798666517447,12.201417631145521,4.973523154460595,2.3145448473507817,4.338363231550999,5.175760020955491,2.4064092939894848,4.3309282530634805,5.6526840930458,4.015847206423585,3.0417976403972378,3.91376839217458,3.671682624179217,4.173607998474943,7.328097998648291,3.968344872438582,2.4194671509069416,4.651235552831338,3.2598521222039762,3.1093338473877252,3.5594492292336284,5.978106493480428,4.005094414647323,3.573410052238122,3.5526232641632287,3.401392294439305,5.870834473677332,2.3415329920684287,1.548205865108894,2.6295528453036945,5.9996668825964115,6.751296381713909,1.9624167136570156,1.0350913870591516,3.8843448980258435]}}
{"reviewText":"I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the \"standard\" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on... I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product. Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume. You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS. WTF?The next issue is the weird \"fizz\" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that \"surrounds\" the note, and fades as the string stops moving. It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency. Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in... but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans. I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12\" Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp. Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care...Definitely try this before you buy it. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is \"something\" wrong.Whatever... I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead. Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked. How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try. But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds.","overall":1.0,"label":0,"clean_text":"purchased amp locally

{"reviewText":"I realized I didn't have any distortion pedals, only a bunch of overdrive pedals, so I set out to find a distortion pedal.  After scouring the forums I find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey.  Since I don't want to spend a bunch of money I get this one and it is great, albeit quite bright.  The only thing I don't like about this pedal is the brightness, which can be tamed with the tone knob, otherwise it is easy to use, sounds really good and is transparent.

{"reviewText":"I received this as a gift for a smaller pedalboard I was assembling - my plan was to try something different to compare against the Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor on my other board.  While I love the build quality and simplicity of the one-knob setup, I can't say (yet) that I like it better than my NS-2.  With the caveat that I may not have it wired up 100% correctly, I felt that it did kill most of the excess noise, but not all of it.  Good product, but maybe not the best of all the options at the same price.

{"reviewText":"I teach class guitar in a community college and bought the SAT800 to loan to students during class. I selected it for the rubber bumpers and beefy build, expecting anything in this day and age to nail pitch quickly and accurately. And, indeed, it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching. Oddly, in one year of use, nobody has dropped it so the bumpers also provide a sure grip in hand and on music stand. My prior smooth plastic Seiko cost four times as much as the SAT800 but managed to hit the deck several times a week. Amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students. However, the display was larger and sported colored note names, so it was more intuitive for beginner use.The built-in mic works fine in a quiet room but is useless in a classroom full of guitars (as are all built-in tuner mics). You need to use a tuner pickup and all is well (I use a Korg tuner pickup). If I were to nick pick I'd have to say the letter name of the pitch is way too small on the LCD. It's tucked in the far right corner in 12 point type and positioned just after the octave number. A lot of students can't read or notice such small type. Also the octave number immediately in front of the letter confuses many beginners as they assume it is the string number (doesn't matter how many times I explain that it isn't). Finally, it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch. Nearly every week somebody inadvertently sets it to A435 or whatever and causes a bunch of other students to be out of tune. A lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade. Most of these nick picks don't apply to pros or advanced players but are something to consider if you're a novice.Add a calibrate safety feature and double the pitch name size and this would be a 5 star product. Right now it's a mere 4.5!","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"teach class guitar community college bought sat loan student class selected rubber bumper beefy build expecting anything day age nail

{"reviewText":"I was looking forward to trying these, as I've loved this company's product since day one.But I think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;HD&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. More profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.I have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. The bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick.When I play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal .012s I've been using (which I think I liked a lot better).It's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but I'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.Again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;HD&#34;

{"reviewText":"I'd give this baby six stars if I could. My prior practice amp (a Vox) was very nice, but finally went south and required replacement. I was looking for something with a great tube sound, as most of the solid-state amps that I've used (mainly fenders and line6 stuff) just don't get there. I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check 'em out and listen side-by-side. The first time I plugged a Strat into this guy in the store, I was blown away (and that was with all of the Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store). I've gotta say, part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a Blues Junior, but the Bugera actually sounded better. The only one left in the store was the floor model, so I grabbed it.Got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations:- It's solid and heavy. It's still a small-fry (slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there), but much heavier.- The construction is great. I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction, but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it's built to last.- The sound is even better at home (without the GC cacophony)- Adjustments are minimal, but enough. The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp. I've run my Strat, Tele and Taylor T5 through this. I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone, but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5- The headphones sound great. I was really surprised by this. I would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone, but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones- The price is self-explanatory, but that's really the part that blew me away. This amp would sell for double the price tag.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"give baby six star could prior practice amp vox nice finally went south required replacement looking something

{"reviewText":"I'll be upfront and honest right away and say that I'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners.  I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired.  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*).A little background first, I guess.  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up.  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner.  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune.  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience.  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away.  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement.I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days.  He was not incredibly pleased with it.  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it.  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock.Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves.  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1.  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark.  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind.  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players.  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3.2.  Looks/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar.  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock.  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them.  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue.3.  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are.  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint.  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use.  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break.  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions.  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner.  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use.All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark.  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone.  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack).  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run.  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option.  But it may not hold up forever.I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"upfront honest right away

{"reviewText":"I'll start off by saying that I'm a proud owner of:- Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 (10 inch, 8 ohm, 30 watts) in an open back, solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 (10 inch, 4ohm, 50 watts)- All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have, what I can play through an amp, and what I can plug an amp head into, I'll sum up my review with this:What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab, the cables you use, and how clean your power is. Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.  So: BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance #3: The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors... though, it will gouge your floor.And then there's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier: if the power is noisy or ungrounded, you will wind up with hiss no matter what.  I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise.  (If you don't have one, get one.  The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work.)The SummaryAfter all that, I can still say:  I love this little amp!  I've gigged with it and it sings well.  Plus, the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price, you can likely afford to pick up $40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig.  And, for the price, this is a solid 4 star amp.  I know I'm happy.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"start saying proud owner gibson e acoustic electric pono msd e blackheart bh h blackheart bh weber vintage series inch ohm watt open back solid

{"reviewText":"I'm going this stompbox as I always do, based on the quality of the pedal and what it does - not necessarily whether than tone is \"useful\" for my particular setup.  Viewed in that objective light, the Joyo JF-13 AC Tone is an excellent pedal for $40 to $45.There are two ways to think of the JF-13 and the other \"Tech 21 clones\" in this line (California, American, British Sound, etc.).  The first is the obvious one, which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain.  This box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to \"clone\" a VOX AC30 amplifier into the speaker.  How effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self.  At the end of the day, if your amplifier (particularly the budget, solid state ones) has certain limitations that you don't like (too bright, not loud enough, too muddy, breaks up too easily...), no pedal (including a $200 boutique one) is going to fully overcome those deficiencies.But the second way to think of the JF-13 is as a preamp, where the output would go directly into a recording device, PA system, computer, or tablet.  I don't have enough experience trying that (though I did a little bit with the Joyo California) to say how well that works, but I've heard great examples of it online.  Also, having the convenience of amp-like controls (with 6 knobs) is certainly very convenient if you like to play/record in that manner.As for the sound of the pedal, it's very good.  I've heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up, but I wouldn't let that concern you.  That's true of virtually any distortion/overdrive pedal, it can be cleaned up with a noise gate/suppressor, and I think the better use of this pedal is on the low- and mid-gain settings anyway.  The \"Drive\" knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp.  It's a very nice tone, responds well to picking, and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume (which many pedal distortions do not do).  The \"Voice\" knob is hard to describe.  Basically, it morphs the tone into something deeper and \"punchier\" as you turn it up.  But that also changes the impact of all your other settings, including drive, EQ, and level.If I had one complaint about this pedal (even compared to the California, also a very cool pedal), I was a little surprised how much this pedal \"wants to be dirty\".  It's tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily.  But, again, I think part of that is you're basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo.  Check out some of the YouTube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder - it could be completely different in that context.  At any rate, it's a very intriguing device at only $40, and I could see finding new uses for it in the future I haven't envisioned yet.UPDATE (April 2013): I actually sold this pedal, instantly regretted it, and then bought it back.  Now that I understand how to use it properly (by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp, through the effects loop), I am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal.  It really is an excellent value, either as a \"foundation pedal\" or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a PA/Speaker system.  I won't be letting the AC Tone go this time :)","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"going stompbox always based quality pedal necessarily whether tone useful particular setup viewed objective light

{"reviewText":"I'm pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years. (I haven't found a wireless unit that I feel comfortable with on stage yet) I was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until I purchased these.

{"reviewText":"I'm using this unit to set up a Linux Digital Audio Workstation. It works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer.

{"reviewText":"I'm very satisfied with the performance of the CM-2.  With a few tweaking, I could emulate the sound I get from my Fulltone OCD.  I'd say it's very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low & high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the \"Tone\" control.  A toggle switch lets you choose between \"classic\" & \"modified\" setting.  A tweaker's delight!  The \"level\" knob has a lot of juice.  If you set it at 10 or 11 o'clock, it's plenty loud enough.  Although you can't use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the \"gain\" knob to zero.  If you have a single coil, it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up, not so for humbuckers (too much gain).  You can also stack the CM-2 with other pedals.  I dusted my old Boss DS-1 and run it along with the CM-2 and was able to get some good tones.  The DS-1 usually hurts my ears but with the CM-2 behind it, sweet!  The Hardwire CM-2 may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from Klon, Zvex or LovePedal, but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost.  It's well built, will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to.  There may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good.  Try it, you can't go wrong!UPDATE:  Did a full comparison between the CM-2, Fulltone OCD & Joyo Crunch Distortion.GAIN:  Joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the CM-2 and OCD, 3rd.MIX:  The CM-2 has the most amount of control with separate high & low controls, followed by the OCD with just a tone control and the Joyo Crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control.

{"reviewText":"I've been stringing my guitars with D'Addario for several years.  While my jazz box is set up with heavy strings, my Les Paul goes lighter--horses for courses, you might say.  I've been using D'Addario XL strings on this guitar for a while, although it's the EXL140 (slightly larger bottoms).  But why not give these lighter strings a try?  The quality is obviously high.  Tone is good, as is durability.  If you do much complex chording, you're going to miss the heavier string, but for shredders and pure rock players these are very nice.  I'll be going back to the EXL 140s, since I prefer the more positive feel of the larger string.  But fat or skinny, D'Addario makes some of the best strings out there.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"stringing guitar addario several year jazz box set heavy string le paul go lighter horse course might say using addario xl string guitar although exl slightly larger bottom give lighter string try quality obviously high tone good durability much complex chording going miss heavier string shredder pure rock player nice going back exl since prefer positive feel larger string fat skinny addario make best string","words":["stringing","guitar","addario","several","year","jazz","box","set","heavy","string","le","paul","go","lighter","horse","course","might","say","using","addario","xl","string","guitar","although","exl","slightly","larger","bottom","give","lighter","string","try","quality","obviously","high","tone","good","durability","much","complex","chording","going","miss","heavier","string","shredder","pure","rock","player","nice","going","back","exl","since","prefer","positive","feel","larger","string","fat","skinny","addario","make","best","string"],"filtered_words":["stringing","guitar","addario","several","year","jazz","box","set","heavy","string","le","paul","go","lighter","horse","course","might","say","using","addario","xl","string","guitar","although","exl","slightly","larger","bottom","give","lighter","string","try","quality","obviously","high","tone","good","durability","much","complex","chording","going","miss","heavier","string","shredder","pure","rock","player","nice","going","back","exl","since","prefer","positive","feel","larger","string","fat","skinny","addario","make","best","string"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[1,38,342,524,569,574,763,862,960,995,1069,1071,1085,1151,1168,1287,1304,1451,1537,1604,2116,2178,2378,2545,2779,2908,2919,2922,3024,3115,3269,3360,3370,3430,3506,3525,3556,3652,3783,3899,3924,3949,3993,4222,4227,4270,4420,4693,4803,4897,4983],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[1,38,342,524,569,574,763,862,960,995,1069,1071,1085,1151,1168,1287,1304,1451,1537,1604,2116,2178,2378,2545,2779,2908,2919,2922,3024,3115,3269,3360,3370,3430,3506,3525,3556,3652,3783,3899,3924,3949,3993,4222,4227,4270,4420,4693,4803,4897,4983],"values":[7.195696724336329,5.845309970449629,2.4711640547213682,1.840481422899865,5.365002020594019,3.5061032485283357,2.4804341095176548,2.3589069600044814,2.164629667290378,7.156761489822074,3.608581917811273,5.265911117949789,11.368396979506802,5.475002915808347,1.3002579281482092,2.827674240442412,4.987707789452551,2.21422660842975,3.9584006488196746,6.223039281215411,2.718531758589635,3.739034806208708,2.261724120476865,3.364085242026494,2.4238579373244313,4.225567737405655,8.574886282247483,3.0215949330797183,3.847131301685409,2.459696039129727,3.8024810279476706,7.038978454165691,1.9506964829791245,2.48510156256515,1.95688419608729,1.974977939529989,5.770467128702183,4.100404594451648,2.3956565022132232,2.2524130662437756,3.147158156055064,3.0813449374854924,5.680854970012496,4.703603538348654,3.244738484393928,5.709842506885749,4.054419481209825,2.695173032312007,2.070182774118303,9.499095706186326,12.11629840230793]}}
{"reviewText":"I've been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while, but I was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings I've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. I was intrigued by the promise of long life, though; I have a Taylor Big Baby that I bought used, and which came with a set of Nanowebs that had probably been on it for a year- and they didn't sound at all like old strings. This review set gave me a chance to finally see for myself how they sound when new.I'd just changed the strings on my 1970s Gibson Gospel a week ago, so I decided that would be my reference. The Nanowebs went on my 1970s Guild D-35. Both are well broken in, solid spruce top guitars. The Gospel is a bit brighter sounding, but I'm pretty familiar with the sound of both guitars. If they D-35 sounded dull, I'd notice.As I was unwrapping the Nanowebs I noticed that while they were labeled \"Light\" gauge, they had a 0.013\" E string- something you'd be more likely to find on a set of medium gauge strings. The B was a .017, compared to the .016 of the D'Addarios I usually play. The rest of the strings were there usual light gauges. Turns out that these are \"HD Light\" gauge, designed to have a slightly more tension and better articulation at the high end. The difference shouldn't be enough to require any truss rod adjustment so I went ahead and installed them on the D-35.So how do they sound? The unwound E and B don't sound different from any other plain steel string, of course. The E does feel a tiny bit stiffer, when I switch between the D-35 and the Gospel. Sound-wise, I'd say they sound like a good set that have been on a guitar for a day. I wouldn't call them dull by any stretch of the imagination. If I didn't know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. So they're good sounding strings, and they last a long time. That leaves the question of cost- are they worth twice the price of uncoated strings?Here's the way I see it: If you're a heavy strummer, or playing gigs every night, maybe not. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. But if you're a finger picker, or a light strummer, a coated string will probably save you a lot of money in the long run. And if you're a hobby player who keeps a guitar around the house, and picks it up once in a while to entertain friends or family, coated strings are probably an excellent choice. For myself, I'm going to leave these on the D-35 for as long as they still sound good. I'll update this review when I find out just how long they do last.Follow up: After playing these for a few days, I actually went out and bought a set in the same gauge for my Loar LH-350, an arch top guitar with a carved top that gets played more than any of my other guitars. They sound great on the Loar, and now I have two guitars to do a long term test on.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"thinking trying nanoweb string bit put high price cost twice much uncharted

{"reviewText":"I've been using Ernie Balls cobalt slinky light gauge because I like the feel.  I got these from the Vine, and wow, they are awesome.  They cost no more than the strings I normally get, but the tone and feel is totally different.  I can't comment on how long they'll last or keep in tune..but for now, I'm impressed.  I'll probably keep using these on my Santana PRS for awhile since I like the sound.  Every once in awhile, I'll step outside of my box...I mean.. I know the strings that I like and I tend to stick with them.  I use d'addario on my acoustic guitars, and ernie balls on my electrics..except for my strat..I like fender bullets on it.

{"reviewText":"I've been using Shure microphones live and in the studio for nearly thirty years now and I can honestly say that I can hear no audible differences between a genuine Shure SM-57 and this GLS Audio ES-57.This isn't based on any scientific data, it's based on A/B'ing this mic and a Shure 57 on the same tube amp at the same volume and distance going through the same mic pre. I made sure that I marked the exact location of the mic with a little masking tape on the amp's speaker grill. I recorded about 30 seconds of the same simple chord progression first with the Shure mic, and then this one. When you play them back either through studio monitors or some very good Bose headphones you can hear no audible difference between the two. If you were to examine the tracks in a waveform editor I'm sure you'll see some visual differences (but they are also two different performances), but my ears really hear nothing audibly different. Some may disagree, but I'm convinced.This mic is built solidly and weighs the same as the Shure and for all intents and purposes looks almost identical both inside and out.Is it as good as the Shure? I don't know, I think so - others may not. I do know that you can buy three of these for the price of one Shure 57 though. I'd highly recommend these on guitar cabinets, snare drums, and toms for sure, maybe vocals in a pinch on a particular type of voice.A no-brainer as far as I can

{"reviewText":"I've been using the snark for a year or so now, and I always have the suspicion that it's just telling me what I want to hear - that my guitar is in tune, when in fact, it's not.  The other day I had to go from standard tuning to DADGAD, and had about 1 minute to do so (plenty of time) but after the tuner said it was in tune, it was time to start playing and it was, well... noticeably out of tune.  After checking each string multiple times!  Very frustrating.  I guess you just have to go with a pedal if you want accuracy.  If you want something that usually puts you in the ballpark but may betray you when it really counts, then go with the Snark.

{"reviewText":"I've had one of these for about 2 years now.  I've made 100's of picks out of old credit cards, gift cards, club cards, plastic sheets, plastic packaging well you get the idea.  THis is fun and easy to do.  I have even sold the picks at garage sales (25 cents each).  My favorite cards to use are the iTunes gift cards (careful cause some of the iTunes cards are cardstock).  They most replicate a Fender Med. pick.  Most credit cards are a bit thicker (somewhere between a Fender Med. and Heavy).  THey work well also (the edges do come out a little rough but I use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily).  I use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results.  The best part is I am NEVER without a pick (even when people accidentally walk off with one.)  I do get funny looks at the stores when I ask for the used gift cards back (until I explain what I do with them- then the clerks are like &#34;wow thats so cool&#34;).  On average I can get 5 picks from a credit card (unless I'm going for a particular part of the card with a design on it).  It takes a little thought to get the most out of the cards- but seeing as they are basically free I don't mind &#34;wasting&#34; parts if I want a particular image.  Just a word of caution on things like DVDs or CDs- they are really too thick and tend to shatter- not worth the effort (I tried an old aol cd and only got one usable pick out of 8

{"reviewText":"I've just received my Mustang I and have spent an hour playing with it and the Fuse software.  This thing is outrageous for a practice amp and I've never heard anything like it in its price class and size!  With a good instrument mic and a decent monitoring system, I think you could probably gig with this thing.  One feature in the Fuse software that no one seems to mention is the ability to add an overdrive or compressor module \"post gain\" (after the preamp). This is an incredibly useful tool for controlling the overdrive characteristics of the amp models.  In effect, Fender has given this amp the ability to emulate power section saturation as the overdrive module sounds very different and much mellower post gain than pre gain (before the preamp like a normal stomp box).I don't know of any other dedicated modelers that do this except maybe the Axe-FX - and that costs about 20 times more.  Power section saturation is highly desirable and is the reason why we're seeing a lot of very low power tube amps like the Fender Champion 600 and Bugera V5 these days. Their problem is that they're pretty much useless for clean sounds at louder volumes - they don't have enough power for that so they're really only good for overdriven sounds.  Not so the Mustang I.  I think Fender has hit the perfect combination of flexibility and and simplicity in one package.  This thing sounds way bigger than it looks and way better than its price would suggest. It has the classic Fender sound and feel of many different Fender amps without the weight, cost and tube replacement needs.  What's not to like?","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"received mustang spent hour playing fuse software thing outrageous practice amp never heard anything like price class size good instrument

{"reviewText":"I've used D'Addario strings for a long time (been playing 20+yrs) and have always been satisfied with their tone. The balanced tension brings a new element to the game of guitar in that these are suppossed to be mathmatically matched to have the perfect degree of tension. Do I fully understand how this works... nope, but they sure do sound good. Their feel is a little more \"snappy\" than regular XL's in my opinion and they have nice clarity as well. Their sound is bright, just like their XL cousins. I think it's more of a \"feel\" thing than a sound thing with these balanced tensioned strings. Now if they could just disect the dna of my guitars and match the tension of the strings with my instruments...All in all a great product that I recommend to any electric guitarist.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"used addario string long time playing yr always satisfied tone balanced tension brings new element game guitar suppossed mathmatically matched perfect degree tension fully understand work nope sure sound good feel little snappy regular xl opinion nice clarity well sound bright like xl cousin think feel thing sound thing balanced tensioned string could disect dna guitar match tension string instrument great product recommend electric guitarist","words":["used","addario","string","long","time","playing","yr","always","satisfied","tone","balanced","tension","brings","new","element","game","guitar","suppossed","mathmatically","matched","perfect","degree","tension","fully","understand","work","nope","sure","sound","good","feel","little","snappy","regular","xl","opinion","nice","clarity","well","sound","bright","like","xl","cousin","think","feel","thing","sound","thing","balanced","tensioned","string","could","disect","dna","guitar","match","tension","string","instrument","great","product","recommend","electric","guitarist"],"filtered_words":["used","addario","string","long","time","playing","yr","always","satisfied","tone","balanced","tension","brings","new","element","game","guitar","suppossed","mathmatically","matched","perfect","degree","tension","fully","understand","work","nope","sure","sound","good","feel","little","snappy","regular","xl","opinion","nice","clarity","well","sound","bright","like","xl","cousin","think","feel","thing","sound","thing","balanced","tensioned","string","disect","dna","guitar","match","tension","string","instrument","great","product","recommend","electric","guitarist"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[52,157,234,447,585,750,1000,1009,1085,1151,1166,1168,1417,1487,1590,1821,1840,1875,1934,2045,2135,2335,2378,2590,3049,3094,3115,3157,3180,3234,3330,3370,3418,3437,3567,3793,3857,3904,3975,4011,4032,4116,4176,4192,4364,4527,4605,4781,4798,4803,4830,4897,4943],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[52,157,234,447,585,750,1000,1009,1085,1151,1166,1168,1417,1487,1590,1821,1840,1875,1934,2045,2135,2335,2378,2590,3049,3094,3115,3157,3180,3234,3330,3370,3418,3437,3567,3793,3857,3904,3975,4011,4032,4116,4176,4192,4364,4527,4605,4781,4798,4803,4830,4897,4943],"values":[4.088708554688457,1.3764038509398002,5.228869846269439,2.1061045213763325,2.6363325322890736,1.2009241203572432,10.709329030168433,4.631032845513819,3.7894656598356002,10.950005831616695,4.0707346392589185,1.3002579281482092,4.6210825146606505,4.088708554688457,1.653464542587499,2.7638567370010096,5.572641385372264,4.005094414647323,3.889095500784441,8.137590742833801,6.017327206633709,2.608161655322377,2.261724120476865,2.801656512714457,6.191680593778488,5.73969547003543,4.919392078259454,1.9044880617754443,6.4636143092621285,7.290292882446597,1.2895854682574375,1.9506964829791245,4.781855735248402,2.6980632077342404,2.6780052286896416,4.316222105673785,4.30563036775323,2.5354719219540995,4.173607998474943,2.8628832419248975,3.39847258433597,2.4551454055657307,4.032196344425115,5.175760020955491,6.145160578143594,1.3452463153629912,1.9624167136570156,2.0831513965644297,6.8802905614730765,2.070182774118303,5.73969547003543,4.749547853093163,2.427163725458931]}}
{"reviewText":"I've used this mic with my Tascam US-800 Audio Interface, and PC, to record a high school chorus concert, and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone. I placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone, and one as a piano/instrument microphone, and have gotten great results from both. The reproduction of the sound was very good. The mic seems very solid in build, and able to possibly take a little abuse, which is good with a travelling recording system, but I definately wouldn't TRY dropping one, even though they're a nice metal case, and metal grill. I'd recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals, and instrumentals, on a budget. I have yet to try these with micing guitar amps, but that's my next step, as well as drums.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"used mic tascam u audio interface pc record high school chorus concert gotten good audio reproduction microphone placed one microphone soloist microphone one piano instrument microphone gotten great result reproduction sound good mic seems solid build able possibly take little abuse good travelling recording system definately try dropping one even though nice metal case metal grill recommend mics anyone looking get good reproduction sound vocal instrumentals budget yet try micing guitar amp next step well drum","words":["used","mic","tascam","u","audio","interface","pc","record","high","school","chorus","concert","gotten","good","audio","reproduction","microphone","placed","one","microphone","soloist","microphone","one","piano","instrument","microphone","gotten","great","result","reproduction","sound","good","mic","seems","solid","build","able","possibly","take","little","abuse","good","travelling","recording","system","definately","try","dropping","one","even","though","nice","metal","case","metal","grill","recommend","mics","anyone","looking","get","good","reproduction","sound","vocal","instrumentals","budget","yet","try","micing","guitar","amp","next","step","well","drum"],"filtered_words":["used","mic","tascam","u","audio","interface","pc","record","high","school","chorus","concert","gotten","good","audio","reproduction","microphone","placed","one","microphone","soloist","microphone","one","piano","instrument","microphone","gotten","great","result","reproduction","sound","good","mic","seems","solid","build","able","possibly","take","little","abuse","good","travelling","recording","system","definately","try","dropping","one","even","though","nice","metal","case","metal","grill","recommend","mics","anyone","looking","get","good","reproduction","sound","vocal","instrumentals","budget","yet","try","micing","guitar","amp","next","step","well","drum"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[9,157,306,373,399,426,615,630,666,735,750,815,855,1030,1166,1168,1342,1406,1424,1558,1590,1823,1874,2116,2169,2350,2473,2655,2679,2717,2790,2921,3014,3052,3273,3370,3385,3496,3550,3551,3567,3619,3783,3991,3996,4037,4044,4116,4219,4232,4268,4347,4426,4485,4605,4693,4706,4803,4926,4991],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[9,157,306,373,399,426,615,630,666,735,750,815,855,1030,1166,1168,1342,1406,1424,1558,1590,1823,1874,2116,2169,2350,2473,2655,2679,2717,2790,2921,3014,3052,3273,3370,3385,3496,3550,3551,3567,3619,3783,3991,3996,4037,4044,4116,4219,4232,4268,4347,4426,4485,4605,4693,4706,4803,4926,4991],"values":[3.889095500784441,1.3764038509398002,3.9632034729381633,5.267230278625147,4.192777914582663,6.21430564288273,5.031510412110944,6.933617938507864,3.5424708926992103,5.046548289475485,1.2009241203572432,3.5412317415724215,2.6514116391161937,4.474029096704154,2.713823092839279,5.201031712592837,2.6908533711674902,2.1149505782573685,10.09309657895097,4.601474043272274,1.653464542587499,19.5844584911991,5.868907201515436,2.718531758589635,4.6112302182176395,2.655563894216961,6.058149201153965,5.835005649839755,5.125329167328599,5.031510412110944,5.73969547003543,3.9944560164422676,3.309277005531499,13.345222711677675,3.7147421136396637,1.9506964829791245,2.822744074334553,3.4523778491721724,3.6014134283326604,7.343365248358434,2.6780052286896416,2.8594760836032833,2.3956565022132232,4.287443141123742,4.071417057578396,3.227389846059315,6.1007088155727605,2.4551454055657307,5.344382733391283,2.7289253191168985,4.448711288719864,2.935417236838666,1.548205865108894,2.9998334412982057,1.9624167136570156,5.390346064624014,4.082911437004131,1.0350913870591516,2.355818949315905,3.958088372271393]}}

{"reviewText":"If you are looking for really authentic vintage tones with tube warmth, this is a fantastic amp for you.Fender has done an amazing job with this amp.IN this AMP, you have:All of the benefits of tubes, warmth at all dynamic levels, as well as a lot of touch sensitivity to your playing.The CHAMP Circuit.  Forget the fact that you have Digital amp models built in too, you also have a 15w Champ tube amp with a 10 inch speaker.  It's not exactly a '57 champ reissue, but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any Champ out there.  (People who like a great Champ tone, would pay more than $299 for a great 15w Champ amp.)Add to this, 16 Digital Presets.  Fender gives you Digital models through a Tube Circuit of Tweed Amps, Blackface Amps, Hot Rod Amps, as well as Metal Amps, A Jazz amp and an Acoustic sounding Model.Add to that some preset digital effects including Reverb, Delay, Vibe, Trem and Chorus.  (Each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effect.)Everyone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the Digital Models are... and they are absolutely right.But this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a Tweed or Hot Rod tone directly to an authentic Champ amp.  Not a model of a Champ Amp, the real deal!The implications of this amp are really huge.  I'd love to see Fender do the same thing with a Pro Jr. or even a Blues Jr. Amp.  Perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp.  who knows.  But what I do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character.The Digital PresetsFor me, the highlights are the authenticity of the Tweed, Blackface and Hot Rod tones.  I really feel like channel 10 sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the 10 inch speaker.  The tweed tones are syruppy and awesome.  The Blackface clean sounds like a Princeton, and I even think they were trying to emulate a Deluxe Reverb on channel 5.As Far as Volume...People ask, is it loud enough to gig with?  Sure.  It can get loud enough over drums etc.  But, I'd mic it anyway.  I get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume.  Mic it and you can play it anywhere.The Only downsides...As much as Fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads, this amp really doesn't give Metalheads that much to work with.  It would be a great practice amp for any guitarist, Blues, Metal, Jazz or Country...But the Metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffs.Lack of a Mid Control.  I'm not sure that I understand why you'd have an EQ with Treble and Bass with no Mid control.  Personally, it's the EQ knob that I would use the most, but if you are switching between Digital Presets you have to work with the Treble and Bass to find the sweet spot for your mids.  To my ears, it's not in the same spot on all presets.  That one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presets.This amp is cool and unique. Which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when Fender releases the next big new thing.  Line 6 and Vox tube/digital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out.  Fender has found a sweet spot of value, quality and usability.  This is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with 10 years later.Truly a unique and versatile creation.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"looking really authentic vintage tone tube warmth fantastic amp fender done amazing job amp amp benefit tube warmth dynamic level well lot touch

{"reviewText":"Im an true analog guy. But when I grabbed this pedal I was blown away. This little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size. A lot of which do not sound to digital. I was amazed at the tones I could pull out of it. For $99- it is a steal. I would pay twice that for what this pedal does. Easy to navigate and understand. Small enough to fit on any pedalboard. Easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches. If you're looking for a multi effects stomp box, look no farther than the Zoom MS-50G. Well worth the $99.00. Can easily set it up for live situations. Of course you're not gonna get all the effects at a drop of a dime. But I set mine up for a few effects I use live. Works flawless. When in the studio, this is where the pedal shines. Also it can't be beat for when you're just jamming alone at home. If you're are gigging, of course this isn't going to be your go to pedal, but it does come in handy for some really nice effects. The review before mine, well they should of known this pedal isn't the greatest for live venues. That's why we have pedalboards with all our different effects we can call up with the drop of a foot. I was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so. Went to a local music store, heard and was sold. No one can touch Amazon's price and service. Get off the fence and buy this pedal. I promise you won't be sorry \\m/CONS: No power supply or USB cable.

{"reviewText":"Most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything I would say however I still want to say I love this tool. Not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt, it's been useful to help me learn the letters of keys. Slowly I am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that I know where I am on the fretboard & where I can go from there. I use it by putting it on my music stand, dialing in the key I want, turn on the drum machine & simply play the chords in that key to the beat. Then when I want to practice the relevant scales of the key, I simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note. It's that easy.I will say that I do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation & theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with. Most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned. To really grasp it, one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly. But with rote repetition, eventually comes that \"Eureka!\" moment from time to time & more falls into place.Unlike some others, I'm not one to lug something this around in my gig bag. Who really is going to set & study material like this prior to a gig? That's what you do at home and it's called 'Practice' for a reason.I give this 5 out of 5 stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool & is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory. If not, you may want to take some lessons & then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"review pretty much covered everything would say

{"reviewText":"My revised review (after about a year of use):The one thing I hated about these is that the screw that is suppose to hold the two pieces on the guitar strap together slowly backs its way out, so if you're not careful, your guitar will fall. It is now a habit of mine to tighten these two parts on the guitar strap, once every few days.My original review:Very easy to install; didn't require drilling. I have these installed on my stratocaster in minutes. Although it looks a little bit big and clunky, it's a small price to pay for stability. I probably will get another set, but may get the black ones instead of the silver because I think the black color may hide the \"clunkyness\" a little better.

{"reviewText":"Over the past couple of months I've been replacing guitar straps.  This one seemed ideal for an everyday all-around strap.  And, it would be, but the holes are too tight.  Really a major chore to get over a strap button.  I had to elongate the slits just to force on the strap.  I've probably bought dozens of straps over the past forty-plus years, and I never had this problem until the latest straps I've purchased--so this strap isn't the only one with which I've had an issue.  A tight-fitting strap isn't in itself a problem, except when one needs to take it off!  Yikes!  Otherwise, this is a nice strap.  Oh, I tried the strap on three guitars, just to be sure the first wasn't an anomaly.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"past couple month replacing guitar strap one seemed ideal everyday around strap would hole tight really major chore get strap button elongate slit force strap probably bought dozen strap past forty plus year never problem latest strap purchased strap one issue tight fitting strap problem except one need take yikes otherwise nice strap oh tried strap three guitar sure first anomaly","words":["past","couple","month","replacing","guitar","strap","one","seemed","ideal","everyday","around","strap","would","hole","tight","really","major","chore","get","strap","button","elongate","slit","force","strap","probably","bought","dozen","strap","past","forty","plus","year","never","problem","latest","strap","purchased","strap","one","issue","tight","fitting","strap","problem","except","one","need","take","yikes","otherwise","nice","strap","oh","tried","strap","three","guitar","sure","first","anomaly"],"filtered_words":["past","couple","month","replacing","guitar","strap","one","seemed","ideal","everyday","around","strap","hole","tight","really","major","chore","get","strap","button","elongate","slit","force","strap","probably","bought","dozen","strap","past","forty","plus","year","never","problem","latest","strap","purchased","strap","one","issue","tight","fitting","strap","problem","except","one","need","take","yikes","otherwise","nice","strap","oh","tried","strap","three","guitar","sure","first","anomaly"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[150,281,391,402,444,719,730,741,815,855,925,1000,1058,1148,1197,1403,1537,1616,1660,1698,1728,1821,1860,2145,2148,2200,2297,2620,2702,3122,3209,3351,3370,3899,4112,4224,4275,4376,4426,4460,4646,4705,4803,4864],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[150,281,391,402,444,719,730,741,815,855,925,1000,1058,1148,1197,1403,1537,1616,1660,1698,1728,1821,1860,2145,2148,2200,2297,2620,2702,3122,3209,3351,3370,3899,4112,4224,4275,4376,4426,4460,4646,4705,4803,4864],"values":[2.9064821259792137,2.822744074334553,4.854176396828029,3.237266469555227,4.93213793829774,5.940366165497581,5.0020965269046505,3.4102029241214598,3.5412317415724215,2.6514116391161937,3.3669061183681355,3.569776343389478,4.945743590353519,4.93213793829774,2.5416409729808147,2.494502336849856,1.9792003244098373,3.1562698364063198,4.112239052098651,5.070943843908199,3.6452160509910536,2.7638567370010096,3.6793749698023723,4.432181986768653,4.474029096704154,7.444443562273855,6.1290048681819895,4.154798666517447,3.3669061183681355,7.290292882446597,7.1885919211275935,26.376940028873946,1.9506964829791245,2.2524130662437756,1.786705026119061,4.361005708300759,7.587570641960233,2.931754229079929,1.548205865108894,4.415921465896873,2.1101157582027854,5.940366165497581,2.070182774118303,3.5978483621681643]}}
{"reviewText":"PROS:* Small. Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf.* If using USB, does not need external power supply.  Very convenient.* Easy-to-use, accessible controls.* Pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio mikes.* Plug & play with Windows 8.  Didn't have to install any kind of driver.* Variety of input options.  Dual track with low/high volume sliders.* LEDs make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range.  Easy to adjust.* Awesome for those who need a mini-mixer-- and costs the same as a USB-based preamp-only device.* Free shipping-- gotta like thatCONS:* Only one power setting, 15v. That may not be enough for some, but works great with my studio mike.* Line In / USB buttons somewhat confusing, non-intuitive.  However the manual shows exact settings for computer use.* As with other low-end Behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out.  Can take some fiddling to overcome it.* It's pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion.  Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good.NOTES:I purchased this for use with my studio mike, which I hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs.  Plugged it in, worked first time, no problems.This unit is very sensitive.  If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room.  With a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work.  I use it for guitar/voice solo live Internet music shows.Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit.  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect... but then it's only fifty bucks.  For the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range, sensitivity and plug-and-play, I don't think one could find a better unit.  Two thumbs up.  I don't know how a Pro would rate this... but I definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average \"USB microphones\" available on the market.  You not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal.  Hard to beat at that price.ADDENDUM:  A few days after the initial review-- I just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast.  No background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission.  Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance.  Quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp.HINTS AND TIPS:Two good hints on this one:* Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 AA cells), hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery.  It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE.* There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound. I have found this to be true. It pretty much takes over your entire sound system. For some folks this will be fine. For others, they may not appreciate this. So what I did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer USB (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait...)... and plugged it into one of those new portable-USB power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10). This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer. What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like Audacity.You then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output, a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want. This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device. You are instead powering it from a USB wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well). That's what I finally did and am still most happy with this device.In addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use. You could use this with Windows, Mac, Linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables. Works very well in this capacity. Gotta love those new external USB power nodes. : )","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"pro small easy take set small shelf using usb need external power supply convenient easy use accessible

{"reviewText":"Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either aMapleorRosewoodneck).---[Update November 15, 2013]I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday!

{"reviewText":"The Joyo Ultimate Overdrive is simply a great pedal. Tone adjustment is precise. The bright switch is an added bonus. Having that in place lends to greater tones and harmonics from this pedal. Construction is first rate and there is absolutly no hum, hiss, loss of signal, nor any excessive coloring of your signal. In short you get 100% drive that has a very broad range to work from. Through a tube amp it just extends the sound to levels that were not possible using the amp's gain alone. Impressive! I can clearly see why so many have stated that this pedal is so good. It just is. I'm not one to argue over perfection, and neither should anyone else that plays guitar and cares about their tone and gear. This one is a winner, hands down!And I'm not a new player either, been at it for nearly 5 decades now. I know tone, and have had great, and not so great gear. This one is a keeper!

{"reviewText":"The Joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros. Ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only $40 so why not? The first thing i learned about this pedal is It does what it's suppose to do but with some drawbacks. There is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal. If you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you'd be up the creek. Although it is a fuzz pedal is it does \"fuzz\" things then that's why I give it 4 stars. I deduct 1 star because the loud feedback. But in the long run I would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"joyo pedal look kool kool feature main pro ive never big fuzz kind player figured first thing learned pedal suppose drawback veryyy loud feedback pedal go pedal didnt noise suppresser creek although fuzz pedal fuzz thing give star deduct star loud feedback long run would check pedal look better alternative","words":["joyo","pedal","look","kool","kool","feature","main","pro","ive","never","big","fuzz","kind","player","figured","first","thing","learned","pedal","suppose","drawback","veryyy","loud","feedback","pedal","go","pedal","didnt","noise","suppresser","creek","although","fuzz","pedal","fuzz","thing","give","star","deduct","star","loud","feedback","long","run","would","check","pedal","look","better","alternative"],"filtered_words":["joyo","pedal","look","kool","kool","feature","main","pro","ive","never","big","fuzz","kind","player","figured","first","thing","learned","pedal","suppose","drawback","veryyy","loud","feedback","pedal","go","pedal","didnt","noise","suppresser","creek","although","fuzz","pedal","fuzz","thing","give","star","deduct","star","loud","feedback","long","run","check","pedal","look","better","alternative"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[170,266,281,350,351,423,460,800,1043,1044,1130,1198,1403,1451,1473,1489,1538,1604,1637,2253,2543,2779,3048,3113,3392,3503,3697,3783,3846,3857,3901,3904,4432,4742,4831,4939],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[170,266,281,350,351,423,460,800,1043,1044,1130,1198,1403,1451,1473,1489,1538,1604,1637,2253,2543,2779,3048,3113,3392,3503,3697,3783,3846,3857,3901,3904,4432,4742,4831,4939],"values":[6.0754486300192045,3.5526232641632287,2.822744074334553,7.712611355922901,7.62676511906781,6.8383077587035395,9.145527874779686,8.137590742833801,5.475002915808347,3.4340846561248473,14.88888712454771,3.23478815354076,2.494502336849856,2.21422660842975,3.573242551365964,5.046548289475485,5.365002020594019,3.1115196406077055,4.232256725556451,8.137590742833801,2.0063642533506596,2.4238579373244313,3.122520851669679,4.7475666617697705,4.517704160206816,12.364279907266127,4.106304316578837,2.3956565022132232,3.100638140420171,4.30563036775323,3.9735128425970245,2.5354719219540995,4.407889294199609,4.7475666617697705,12.031369073366125,4.591961124764543]}}

{"reviewText":"The audio jack on my laptop was failing.  I had to wiggle and twist the headphone plug until I could hear both channels.  By that time half the youtube video was over.  What a hassle!  I'm trying to imagine how can I crack the case, get in there with my soldering gun to replace the audio jack when I ran across this great idea.  A plug-and-play USB device with both input and output audio jacks.  Took about one minute to install on my Dell Inspiron, which recognized it immediately.

{"reviewText":"The last amplifier I purchased was a Fender Twin valve some years ago. It is difficult to use in a small apartment - too loud!! So, after giving up trying to use this with the volume at '1', I searched for a smaller thing. This amp looked suspiciously cheap and, although the reviews were great, still was concerned whether it would be good enough. It arrived and I got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features, including recording. This was really a mind blowing thing. The built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals, and I no longer use my Zoom. Setting it emulate a twin reverb, with the effects used lightly, I am amazed at both the quality of this 'practise amp' and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck!!!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"last amplifier purchased fender twin valve year ago difficult use small apartment loud giving trying use volume searched smaller thing amp looked suspiciously cheap although review great still concerned whether would good enough arrived got realizing went web downloading presets kind feature including recording really mind blowing thing built sound effect better many effect pedal longer use zoom setting emulate twin reverb effect used lightly amazed quality practise amp recommend anybody want huge bang buck","words":["last","amplifier","purchased","fender","twin","valve","year","ago","difficult","use","small","apartment","loud","giving","trying","use","volume","searched","smaller","thing","amp","looked","suspiciously","cheap","although","review","great","still","concerned","whether","would","good","enough","arrived","got","realizing","went","web","downloading","presets","kind","feature","including","recording","really","mind","blowing","thing","built","sound","effect","better","many","effect","pedal","longer","use","zoom","setting","emulate","twin","reverb","effect","used","lightly","amazed","quality","practise","amp","recommend","anybody","want","huge","bang","buck"],"filtered_words":["last","amplifier","purchased","fender","twin","valve","year","ago","difficult","use","small","apartment","loud","giving","trying","use","volume","searched","smaller","thing","amp","looked","suspiciously","cheap","although","review","great","still","concerned","whether","good","enough","arrived","got","realizing","went","web","downloading","presets","kind","feature","including","recording","really","mind","blowing","thing","built","sound","effect","better","many","effect","pedal","longer","use","zoom","setting","emulate","twin","reverb","effect","used","lightly","amazed","quality","practise","amp","recommend","anybody","want","huge","bang","buck"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[94,97,133,188,222,313,350,372,402,619,750,759,903,971,1010,1044,1132,1162,1166,1168,1260,1324,1349,1375,1446,1473,1712,1896,1927,2198,2211,2334,2369,2543,2712,2779,2904,2997,3184,3229,3305,3318,3406,3503,3505,3506,3673,3712,3857,3899,3989,4029,4112,4116,4326,4349,4371,4376,4465,4473,4485,4605,4748,4775,4837,4877,4926],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[94,97,133,188,222,313,350,372,402,619,750,759,903,971,1010,1044,1132,1162,1166,1168,1260,1324,1349,1375,1446,1473,1712,1896,1927,2198,2211,2334,2369,2543,2712,2779,2904,2997,3184,3229,3305,3318,3406,3503,3505,3506,3673,3712,3857,3899,3989,4029,4112,4116,4326,4349,4371,4376,4465,4473,4485,4605,4748,4775,4837,4877,4926],"values":[3.7851645779362095,4.526672830189576,3.9889673974016224,2.751567795866658,2.575627881662224,3.4102029241214598,3.8563056779614504,4.535722665709494,3.237266469555227,3.62307492511384,1.2009241203572432,3.13812874933567,4.71441445445287,5.031510412110944,2.3723996400489558,3.4340846561248473,5.903998521326706,6.671253674040373,1.3569115464196395,1.3002579281482092,2.8211060723303145,8.856206611293324,3.8380403299841572,5.940366165497581,7.156761489822074,3.573242551365964,4.032196344425115,3.7808819161442084,3.369734974568613,4.308949346344705,3.437110377041384,4.407889294199609,3.7981237225787146,2.0063642533506596,2.287305809188598,2.4238579373244313,4.517704160206816,5.365002020594019,4.106304316578837,10.859081083463181,5.247218984937636,3.656473205515688,4.55407180437769,2.060713317877688,4.987707789452551,1.95688419608729,4.179957226153602,2.4194671509069416,4.30563036775323,2.2524130662437756,2.566704941644031,2.751567795866658,1.786705026119061,2.4551454055657307,5.228869846269439,5.452013397583649,3.82455697964687,2.931754229079929,2.6295528453036945,5.344382733391283,2.9998334412982057,1.9624167136570156,2.5317886765378033,5.365002020594019,6.4636143092621285,4.154798666517447,4.71163789863181]}}
{"reviewText":"The odor of adhesive lingered for some time, but that's not really a problem.Size and fit were good. The storage compartment is nice and large.One hinge broke after about a year of normal use.

I noticed if you look carefully, one of the hinges is cracked on both sides, so it is not holding anything anymore, but it is one of three, so the other two still do the job just fine. It is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured.This was not an expensive guitar, and I had a better case, so I switched to the better guitar case, and used this one for another guitar that I really don't play at all, and it just stays in storage.","overall":3.0,"label":1,"clean_text":"odor adhesive lingered time really problem size fit good storage compartment nice large one hinge broke year normal use house almost whole time open case play guitar replace done noticed look carefully one hinge cracked side holding anything anymore one three two still job fine look carefully see one hinge fractured expensive guitar better case switched better guitar case used one another guitar really play stay storage","words":["odor","adhesive","lingered","time","really","problem","size","fit","good","storage","compartment","nice","large","one","hinge","broke","year","normal","use","house","almost","whole","time","open","case","play","guitar","replace","done","noticed","look","carefully","one","hinge","cracked","side","holding","anything","anymore","one","three","two","still","job","fine","look","carefully","see","one","hinge","fractured","expensive","guitar","better","case","switched","better","guitar","case","used","one","another","guitar","really","play","stay","storage"],"filtered_words":["odor","adhesive","lingered","time","really","problem","size","fit","good","storage","compartment","nice","large","one","hinge","broke","year","normal","use","house","almost","whole","time","open","case","play","guitar","replace","done","noticed","look","carefully","one","hinge","cracked","side","holding","anything","anymore","one","three","two","still","job","fine","look","carefully","see","one","hinge","fractured","expensive","guitar","better","case","switched","better","guitar","case","used","one","another","guitar","really","play","stay","storage"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[107,133,307,354,370,433,440,557,627,783,815,836,925,1009,1168,1175,1342,1429,1431,1480,1698,1903,2022,2114,2173,2191,2543,2707,3157,3166,3192,3199,3348,3370,3566,3593,3636,3712,3899,3975,4112,4152,4605,4728,4781,4798,4803,4859,4939],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[107,133,307,354,370,433,440,557,627,783,815,836,925,1009,1168,1175,1342,1429,1431,1480,1698,1903,2022,2114,2173,2191,2543,2707,3157,3166,3192,3199,3348,3370,3566,3593,3636,3712,3899,3975,4112,4152,4605,4728,4781,4798,4803,4859,4939],"values":[6.191680593778488,1.3296557991338742,4.407889294199609,2.7244577018571823,3.7067739439904868,3.2497510262174725,4.392015945043319,2.8577768478503236,4.0432461806117,3.879616756829898,5.902052902620703,4.384172767582293,3.3669061183681355,4.631032845513819,1.3002579281482092,17.31140138610655,8.07256011350247,6.058149201153965,2.6751723656053374,2.9671067477956488,2.5354719219540995,4.770294912847326,3.4102029241214598,3.3281200933329793,4.4699148188648685,4.384172767582293,4.012728506701319,3.6267312363169504,3.8089761235508885,2.648653016677114,3.068686540613569,4.179957226153602,2.5075744184172084,1.9506964829791245,3.2151796821523835,5.498533413218542,9.302471105662676,2.4194671509069416,2.2524130662437756,8.347215996949886,3.573410052238122,4.535722665709494,1.9624167136570156,2.5342426654993697,2.0831513965644297,3.4401452807365382,4.140365548236606,3.908326862712329,4.591961124764543]}}
{"reviewText":"The reason I bought this pedal was for the &#34;Space&#34; setting, which is essentially a shimmering organ, octave up effect. On the shortest time it is still slightly off with tracking, and it can get crowded with chords, but it does sound ethereal and choir-y.Features:Time controls the delay time between the dry and wet signals, decay controls the length of the reverberations, tone controls the color of the reverb, and mix controls the level of wet to dry (it can basically cut all the dry signal if desired).The trails feature can hold a reverb sound until it decays even with the switch off; however, if your mix is set to max wet signal, no sound will come through if enable and the pedal is off. I haven't really been able to use it effectively, so I just leave trails off.Dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument.Sounds:The classic reverb sounds (spring, plate, room, chamber) aren't very distinct from one another. The hall setting is bit more expansive; the ducking is nice for a continual shift from note to note, removing excess reverb for the latest notes/chords played. The cave and tile are a bit different timbre than the other reverb sounds; and the echo setting acts like a short regular digital delay.Cons:*The blue led is VERY bright, as on all Behringer pedals; I just cover it up with a sticker, and it still shows through.*the foot switch is digital, so it doesn't preserve state, and doesn't have the best assuring &#34;click&#34;*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift upAlso, almost 50% of the pedals weight is the bottom metal plate, which can be removed, but that makes the pedal almost toy-like in weight.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"reason bought

The information is not straight forth, and the \"how to\" especially on setting up the device was severely lacking.  This left me to the old plug and chug method.  Once I figured out how to set it up...I found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker.  The DR did sound better with ear buds, but still was short of what I expected based on the reviews on Amazon and other websites.

{"reviewText":"These are a direct drop in replacement on Fender Standard (MIM) stratocasters, Fender American Standard, Fender American Deluxe.I have replaced my tuners of this style with Fenders locking version that looks just like these but has a thumbwheel on the back.Unfortunately, the locking ones are difficult to get in a gold finish. (But you can get them, ultimately.)I ordered a set of these non-locking ones - the finish is nice and is the deep dark gold that matches fender's /schaller's gold hardware. (not all gold hardware is the same color gold). The quality is good and they look and function well. However, I returned them because they are not locking...I ultimately decided a locking tuner was more important for the guitar I was building.If you just want gold tuners, don't care about the string locking feature, and are playing a fender strat or tele - you can't beat these.

{"reviewText":"These are your basic speaker stands for PA systems...they're functional, durable, and can be set-up within just a few seconds. I would have given this a higher rating, however upon receipt, one of the stands would not lock into place and kept sliding down regardless of how tight I had set the tension. While inspecting the bag, I found a hard plastic block which looked like it was part of the aluminum tubing of the speaker stand. Further inspection confirmed this as this 'block' was indeed part of the tube, and after several minutes of wrestling with it, I was able to get it lodged back inside. The block was part of the tension &#34;mechanism&#34; and once it was forced back into the tube, the stand(s) performed flawlessly.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"basic speaker stand pa system functional durable set within second would given higher rating however upon receipt one stand would lock place kept sliding regardless tight set tension inspecting bag found hard plastic block looked like part aluminum tubing speaker stand inspection confirmed block indeed part tube several minute wrestling able get lodged back inside block part tension mechanism forced back tube stand performed flawlessly","words":["basic","speaker","stand","pa","system","functional","durable","set","within","second","would","given","higher","rating","however","upon","receipt","one","stand","would","lock","place","kept","sliding","regardless","tight","set","tension","inspecting","bag","found","hard","plastic","block","looked","like","part","aluminum","tubing","speaker","stand","inspection","confirmed","block","indeed","part","tube","several","minute","wrestling","able","get","lodged","back","inside","block","part","tension","mechanism","forced","back","tube","stand","performed","flawlessly"],"filtered_words":["basic","speaker","stand","pa","system","functional","durable","set","within","second","given","higher","rating","however","upon","receipt","one","stand","lock","place","kept","sliding","regardless","tight","set","tension","inspecting","bag","found","hard","plastic","block","looked","like","part","aluminum","tubing","speaker","stand","inspection","confirmed","block","indeed","part","tube","several","minute","wrestling","able","get","lodged","back","inside","block","part","tension","mechanism","forced","back","tube","stand","performed","flawlessly"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[73,97,125,211,342,415,419,521,661,815,911,955,1000,1061,1063,1161,1296,1390,1611,1636,1735,1886,2271,2285,2411,2494,2587,2635,2690,3030,3209,3330,3357,3430,3454,3496,3740,3996,4023,4066,4132,4218,4227,4256,4426,4433,4576,4617,4817,4934],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[73,97,125,211,342,415,419,521,661,815,911,955,1000,1061,1063,1161,1296,1390,1611,1636,1735,1886,2271,2285,2411,2494,2587,2635,2690,3030,3209,3330,3357,3430,3454,3496,3740,3996,4023,4066,4132,4218,4227,4256,4426,4433,4576,4617,4817,4934],"values":[5.709842506885749,4.526672830189576,2.876629162829533,4.232256725556451,4.9423281094427365,3.4431894231177664,4.368668581046328,6.671253674040373,4.682326139901369,2.360821161048281,2.9998334412982057,3.1935701978195286,7.139552686778956,2.9262847532753935,4.945743590353519,3.8156680322296244,4.945743590353519,3.2224878754591084,3.4310680625854215,6.808641108436786,5.15866558759619,9.784423183952022,6.402989687445694,5.19315176366736,3.5628797643304178,7.658062520083583,2.9785354436192715,3.8609246238177453,6.597145701886651,2.965214599643611,3.5942959605637967,1.2895854682574375,4.054419481209825,4.9702031251303,16.158166289375554,3.4523778491721724,9.903926507646968,4.071417057578396,6.8383077587035395,3.70281354277439,5.1090686464568185,5.016695326325803,3.244738484393928,3.5526232641632287,1.548205865108894,6.017327206633709,4.106304316578837,5.1090686464568185,4.544855149272767,5.365002020594019]}}

{"reviewText":"These strings are nickel which greatly reduces fret and saddle wear and they sound good.  If you are using stainless steel strings you are wearing those two critical guitar components down and they will eventually have to be replaced.  Saddles are easy to replace fret wire can be costly as that type of work is best left to the experts which with it comes an added cost to the player.\\So I (and many others) play nickel.Bullet end?  If you are playing a Stratocaster with a tremolo bridge the bullets are designed to fit into the string receivers in the trem block and in effect add more mass to the tremolo block which adds and aids the transfer of tone to the guitar as a whole.Those two beneficial features alone convinced me to give these an honest try and over time (I've been using these for years) have proven to me to be the optimal string for the Stratocaster.These are durable.  Do they last?  Well, yes they do.  I rotate guitars on the gigs so I would say that if I was using the strat exclusively and playing it as much as I do through the week - I end up changing them out every 2 to 3 weeks and I'm playing 4 nights per week not including rehearsal or noodling around and I put them through a rigorous workout.What would that equate to  in hours?  Hmmm...  60 to 80 hours perhaps, maybe a bit more.  Add to that sweat, natural oils, oxidation, and that I don't use cleaners or chems on the strings, although I do wipe them down after a playing with a dry shop towel.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"string nickel greatly reduces fret saddle wear sound good using stainless steel string wearing two critical guitar component eventually replaced saddle

This is so much better than my Intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what I paid for the Intellitouch. It's very affordable and is something no guitarist should be without.

{"reviewText":"This had to be designed by someone who understood the need for well-placed lighting for those who need to read sheet music while performing. the flexible necks allow you to quickly twist and aim the light 'just right' over two open pages. The battery operation is nice if you want to be portable, but I have found that the AC adapter (Mine came with the light, check to be sure you get one with yours) is the way to go if you have a piano or keyboard in place where you practice every day. My Duracell batteries ran down quickly, over a few weeks before I noticed the light becoming slightly less and less. The AC adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness. The whole unit is light enough to clip onto a music stand back or to a music book that you place other sheet music in front of. I needed to buy an extension cord as the AC adapter cord is only about 6 feet long, and while that sounds like a lot, by the time you lay it out where you want it (out of the way to avoid tripping) you might need to add an extension cord too. I understand the LED's themselves last a long long time, so that is good, they operate at a very cool low temperature so no hazard there. All in all, these do the job, illuminating with a pleasant easy to read-by light.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"designed someone understood need well placed lighting need read sheet music

{"reviewText":"This is a great little amp especially for the money. It's all tube, has a power attenuator, headphone out and reverb all for under $200 - CRAZY!! It's built extremely well and has some weight to it, but you'd have no problem carrying it to a small gig. A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD, so the attenuator is a god-send.How does it sound you ask? Tone is subjective, but to my ears it can get quite \"Marshally\" without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele. I don't own a Strat, so I can't comment on single coils through it. On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good \"Back In Black\" style hard rock tone. If you want to play Metal you're going to need a distortion/overdrive pedal. I've found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy. The headphone out isn't great, it's good enough for practice, but don't try to use it as a line out for recording.I've done some recording using a 57 on-axis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center. When stacking 3-4 tracks (especially using different guitars) I got a HUGE, Plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzy.I haven't swapped tubes or the speaker - it's completely stock. I might try putting a Jensen speaker in it, but the stock tone is just fine as it is. The stock speaker is an 8\" Bugera \"vintage\" (think greenback clone) and it is darker than a lot of small speakers. A lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for JJ's or GT's, but it all depends on what you're after for tone.A lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the Beringer name on it (Bugera is made by Beringer), but I found this amp to be very good quality - especially given that it was made in China.I would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap. It's an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type. I was able to get great Marshall like tone out of it quite easily.

{"reviewText":"This is a modeling amp.  IT has several presets, to emulate different sounds.  They factory settings for these are pretty good, and all but the first bank (of three) can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp.  If you get the fender fuse software (license comes with the amp) you can get some pretty amazing &#34;pre&#34; sets from fender and other users.This is not a massive cabinet, so you aren't going to get that &#34;big&#34; a sound, regardless. But for a small room it's great!Common complaint I have seen:  No clean channel/preset.This is not the case.  There are a couple of factory presets that are &#34;clean&#34; although some people want cleaner.  You can either adjust the gain/vol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums.  That said, one of my guitars is edgy, it wants to overdrive the amp.  Another doesn't, and is very clean, even on the factory preset clean.I very nearly got a different amp.  I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II.  I was sold when he showed me what all it could do - then showed me the price for a Mustang I!!  For ~$100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask for.It'll keep me busy for a long time.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"modeling amp several presets emulate different sound

{"reviewText":"This is a very good investment. Everything just sits in this case  so I never have to set up any cables again. All I do is setup the input from guitar to the case, from the case to the amp, and let's not forget the power cable. It works amazing and saves plenty of time. I've also seen reviews that it's VERY druable, so you don't have to worry about it breaking easily. I love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals (such as wah or volume). The only concern by some people was a slight buzzing. I replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals, and the sound went away.

{"reviewText":"This is my first amp, which I am using with my new Applause AE148-RRB Acoustic Electric Guitar (also purchased from Amazon).  The guitar sounds great when hooked up to this amp.  My only complaint is that as a first time amp owner/user I needed a bit more help on how to adjust the settings and this product came with NO paperwork at all.  Not sure if that is normal or if it was just omitted from the unit I received.  I downloaded the users manual from the Pyle website but it was also not much help.  But just by trying different settings I have managed to find what, for me, is the &#34;sweet spot&#34; for my guitar when paired with this amp.  Very happy with the amp and also happy that I spent the extra few dollars to get the 60 amp rather than the 30 amp version.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"first amp using new applause ae rrb acoustic electric guitar also purchased amazon guitar sound great hooked amp complaint first time amp owner user needed bit help adjust setting product came paperwork sure normal omitted unit received downloaded user manual pyle website also much help trying different setting managed find sweet spot guitar paired amp happy amp also happy spent extra dollar get amp rather amp version","words":["first","amp","using","new","applause","ae","rrb","acoustic","electric","guitar","also","purchased","amazon","guitar","sound","great","hooked","amp","complaint","first","time","amp","owner","user","needed","bit","help","adjust","setting","product","came","paperwork","sure","normal","omitted","unit","received","downloaded","user","manual","pyle","website","also","much","help","trying","different","setting","managed","find","sweet","spot","guitar","paired","amp","happy","amp","also","happy","spent","extra","dollar","get","amp","rather","amp","version"],"filtered_words":["first","amp","using","new","applause","ae","rrb","acoustic","electric","guitar","also","purchased","amazon","guitar","sound","great","hooked","amp","complaint","first","time","amp","owner","user","needed","bit","help","adjust","setting","product","came","paperwork","sure","normal","omitted","unit","received","downloaded","user","manual","pyle","website","also","much","help","trying","different","setting","managed","find","sweet","spot","guitar","paired","amp","happy","amp","also","happy","spent","extra","dollar","get","amp","rather","amp","version"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[313,347,402,440,447,524,552,585,619,750,780,867,882,960,1053,1166,1280,1300,1335,1403,1470,1494,1683,1821,1989,2162,2417,2465,2510,2529,2590,2596,2755,2803,2837,2891,2930,2968,3157,3300,3601,3721,3758,3792,3864,4320,4347,4413,4426,4803,4926,4989],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,7.0,1.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[313,347,402,440,447,524,552,585,619,750,780,867,882,960,1053,1166,1280,1300,1335,1403,1470,1494,1683,1821,1989,2162,2417,2465,2510,2529,2590,2596,2755,2803,2837,2891,2930,2968,3157,3300,3601,3721,3758,3792,3864,4320,4347,4413,4426,4803,4926,4989],"values":[6.8204058482429195,6.209953084037539,3.237266469555227,4.392015945043319,2.1061045213763325,1.840481422899865,3.200721598977154,2.6363325322890736,3.62307492511384,1.2009241203572432,3.205517771240647,4.682326139901369,8.864363973537307,2.164629667290378,3.8380403299841572,1.3569115464196395,5.802215827016764,3.879616756829898,3.172417822814302,4.989004673699712,3.722774285336928,3.11590561255096,2.689417620741386,2.7638567370010096,2.468859906236518,2.874900553928915,4.945743590353519,3.656473205515688,2.736415990846056,6.191680593778488,2.801656512714457,4.71441445445287,6.933617938507864,5.5986168717755245,3.908326862712329,4.805386232658597,3.9944560164422676,2.4064092939894848,1.9044880617754443,4.015847206423585,3.483630392676277,6.597145701886651,3.2598521222039762,5.9228278163974775,6.058149201153965,2.965214599643611,5.870834473677332,4.805386232658597,1.548205865108894,3.105274161177455,16.490732645211338,5.868907201515436]}}
{"reviewText":"This is my first mixer. I'd been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USB-powered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and, of course, that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups.Thus, I am an amateur and you'll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional.Anyway, my pros and consPros1. This thing is way smaller than I expected. I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn't take up a lot of desk space. It fits well where I put it.2. It works as intended. I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good. I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60%. I have no hissing and no problems. I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host (we do it over Skype) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good. This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball.3. It's plug and play. I plugged it in, it installed the drivers, and it automatically set itself as the default microphone. Easy peasy.4. I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately.5. The dials and everything was easy to understand.Cons1. You can't plug this into a USB hub (or even an AC-powered USB hub) otherwise you'll get a hiss. This needs to be plugged directly into a computer.2. This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows. To fix it, open your Control Panel, open the Sound, and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem. Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended. Since I use this as my main mic, I left it as default in the Sound settings.Overall, for the price, this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs. I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I'm on a budget. It's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money. If you're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts, this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person. Worth every penny as long as it lasts. I'll update when/if it breaks down but until then, I do not regret this purchase.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"first mixer looking cheap way upgrade usb powered mics like blue snowball

{"reviewText":"This little beast works great for guitars or basses in loud or soft environments.  Just clip it to your headstock and tune up in under 30 seconds.  I've even used it on the bell of my trumpet to tune up to pitch.Pros:- Dead-on accurate.  You can easily set your intonation with this little monster.- Works great in extremely loud environments.- Clips on tightly.  If you don't jump around like an orangutan on stage, you could probably have the Snark ride your headstock through the whole show.- You don't have to plug into it.- Extremely responsive.- Enough display detail for you to know when you're getting close to in tune -- not just 3 indicators like some tuners (flat, dead-on, sharp).- Very inexpensive.Cons:- A little twitchy on the open low B string on bass. I use the 12th fret harmonics (first partial) to tune, however, since it's a purer tone that seems to resonate in the headstock more, so this has never really been a problem for me.Inexpensive enough to keep one in every gig bag or case -- for every instrument you own.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"little beast work great guitar bass loud soft environment clip headstock tune second even

{"reviewText":"This little fellow is great. The proper connection from the Focusrite comes with the box. Hooks to the USB port on my MacBook Pro. Everything else plugs right in. No hassle with the right jacks and stuff. My headphone jack was a different size but I went from 1/8 to 1/4&#34; with a reducer I had on hand. I can turn the computer on and play my guitars without opening a program. I've been recording using Garage Band. Works great.

{"reviewText":"This little jewel is so small it can hide in your hand, but it delivers decent tone at a decent volume to your headphones for practicing indoors or outdoors over traffic sounds even. Its 1/4\" TS plug goes directly into your bass's instrument cable jack, and it has one 1/8\" TRS output jack for your headphone plug. But it also has a second 1/8\" TRS input jack which allows you to connect your computer or mp3 player or cell phone so you can hear yourself playing over play-alongs or any such music source, both directly into your headphones.Its on-off switch has a third position for overdrive distortion, which I never use. It has both gain and volume output controls and both work. It also has a tone control but I cannot discern that it does anything. Could be that I just have a defective sample, but I don't care because the tone is fine just as it is.Others have described this little headphone amp as seeming somewhat fragile, and I don't argue with that--it does feel a bit thinly made and the 2xAAA battery door does seem weak. But I just take a little extra care not to drop it or bang it around in a gig bag. If the battery door eventually falls off, I'll use duct tape, and when this little thing completely wears out, I'll buy another. It's just too handy and easy to travel with not to own--and, as I said, it does the job.EDIT 2013-04-07: Still working fine.","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"little jewel small hide hand

{"reviewText":"This snark thing is the cats meow, its absolutely Charlie. It hears things I don't and tells me whether they are what I want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together.If you like being in tune, this is probably for you. It is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything. You can clamp it on a cat's tail, but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don't even think about doing that you sicko.Great design, easy to read, works better than 2 other brand tuners I own. only bummer is you can't carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one. If it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about 400 dollars, oh well.I suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool, hip, out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of

{"reviewText":"This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem: At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother. I'm not talking about extreme settings, just gain and &#34;character&#34; (thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it) at 3 o'clock. It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals) If only it didn't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal.

{"reviewText":"UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review.The 2i2 is a simple set-up. Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \"low-headroom\" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters. It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless. (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed \"Ballsdogit!!!\", and purchased a license for Reaper. After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer \"lock up\", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers. Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time.Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that \"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..\", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \"get something with more headroom like the 2i4.\" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here.","overall":1.0,"label":0,"clean_text":"updated owning year encountering many difficulty revising gleaming review simple set pretty much run

{"reviewText":"Unit is sturdy. Lots of good presets and capabilities. Works with down-loadable X-Edit software. That gets confusing a bit because the unit displays one thing, the computer screen another. I haven't mastered it yet and after a month am just knocking about and settling on sounds that are acceptable but far from ideal. I've see much easier software that puts all effects on screen as stomp box graphics and you build a sound. With the X-Edit you call up a canned sound and start changing it.

{"reviewText":"Wanted to review this pedal because I felt some of the other reviews were a little lukewarm.  Distortion is incredibly subjective-it depends on your rig and your tastes. But the Badass '78 by MXR is a very nice pedal for a decent price.  It doesn't do metal or super high-gain, but offers some nice classic rock tones and can be quite warm if you back off on the tone knob. The crunch button adds brightness and volume and may or may not be too harsh for your setup.  However, the tone knob does do a pretty good job of rolling back the high end, especially if you activate the \"crunch\" button.The build quality seems to be pretty good, though I should note that while the pedal is the same size as other MXR pedals, it is significantly lighter.  I suppose this could make it more susceptible to denting and damage if it travels, but it should be plenty durable for 95% of users.  I really like the switch on this one too, it's easy to press and clearly clicks \"on\" once depressed.  One minor annoyance if you use the \"crunch\" setting is that the blue light (which is annoyingly bright like an LED headlight) stays on EVEN when the pedal itself is off.  This can be quite distracting if you rely on the lights on your pedal board to tell you which effects are on.  Not really a major gripe that detracts from the pedal's quality, but a frustrating design decision.Basically, if you get the right setup, you'll get great tone.  I got this pedal specifically to try and find a better alternative to the BOSS DS-1, which lacks mids and can sound harsh/abrasive.  The MXR '78 Badass is definitely superior in that regard, but a lot will depend on your rig and settings.  I find that this pedal really excels on playing single notes on the lower strings (think \"Walk this Way\" by Aerosmith, or \"Hangingaround\" intro by Counting Crows).  And if you pair it with a fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal, you could probably thicken it up a bit for higher solos.  Great pedal!","overall":5.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"wanted review pedal felt review little lukewarm distortion incredibly subjective depends rig taste badass mxr nice pedal decent price metal super

{"reviewText":"We've been only using it for two days, and so far so good. I cannot say anything about durability for now, but I'll update this review if it breaks.====One of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old BOSS TU-12 chromatic tuner forever for her violin, and I finally bought this for her.There are many clip-on tuners, but I liked the following about this tuner:1. LCD mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you're off (as opposed to just flat or sharp).2. You can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic. Most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway, but a mic sometimes comes in handy.3. Can set different pitch than A=440.4. Not expensive (was less than [...]$ including shipping).Upon delivery I tried it on my guitars (both acoustic and electric) using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid, and was impressed.It is quick to track the note even for low E. It's not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on. No stress whatsoever, indeed it's just as quick and smooth as my BOSS. LCD is bright and clear, and needle-ish display works as expected.It worked very well on violin too. And I saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun.And a note about the looks. From the picture I expected it to be ugly, but actually it was not that bad. It's tiny and doesn't look like a Fisher-Price product.====First update, Nov 24 2010: I've tried it on an electric bass (4 string), and it worked equally well. Still 5 stars.====Second update, Oct 20 2011: It's still working happily for my daughter, and I bought a second unit for myself.

{"reviewText":"Well, i just got started playing guitar, and needed a tuner. This thing works well so far, but i didn't have the proper 1/4 inch connector yet to hook my guitar straight into the tuner, which i think would have made it work better. So i used the built-in microphone to tune my guitar. Had no problem with the first through fourth strings, but it had a very hard time picking up the much lower fifth and sixth strings. However, i found that the other strings were very well tuned when all was said and done, and i am happy with my purchase.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"well got started playing guitar needed tuner thing work well far proper inch connector yet hook guitar straight tuner think would made work better used built microphone tune guitar problem first fourth string hard time picking much lower fifth sixth string however found string well tuned said done happy purchase","words":["well","got","started","playing","guitar","needed","tuner","thing","work","well","far","proper","inch","connector","yet","hook","guitar","straight","tuner","think","would","made","work","better","used","built","microphone","tune","guitar","problem","first","fourth","string","hard","time","picking","much","lower","fifth","sixth","string","however","found","string","well","tuned","said","done","happy","purchase"],"filtered_words":["well","got","started","playing","guitar","needed","tuner","thing","work","well","far","proper","inch","connector","yet","hook","guitar","straight","tuner","think","made","work","better","used","built","microphone","tune","guitar","problem","first","fourth","string","hard","time","picking","much","lower","fifth","sixth","string","however","found","string","well","tuned","said","done","happy","purchase"],"rawFeatures":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[86,89,125,157,264,347,524,542,814,869,911,1010,1061,1198,1403,1664,1698,2039,2162,2178,2335,2368,2543,2631,2707,2723,3052,3157,3303,3344,3857,4025,4037,4158,4320,4376,4527,4605,4781,4803,4897],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0]},"features":{"type":0,"size":5000,"indices":[86,89,125,157,264,347,524,542,814,869,911,1010,1061,1198,1403,1664,1698,2039,2162,2178,2335,2368,2543,2631,2707,2723,3052,3157,3303,3344,3857,4025,4037,4158,4320,4376,4527,4605,4781,4803,4897],"values":[4.781855735248402,4.793453186546135,2.876629162829533,4.129211552819401,6.191680593778488,3.1049765420187696,1.840481422899865,3.23478815354076,4.060053298928081,3.39847258433597,2.9998334412982057,2.3723996400489558,2.9262847532753935,3.23478815354076,2.494502336849856,3.2674954715165443,2.5354719219540995,4.205765110109475,2.874900553928915,3.739034806208708,2.608161655322377,2.844285918109308,2.0063642533506596,3.8380403299841572,3.6267312363169504,4.631032845513819,3.3363056779194187,1.9044880617754443,3.9328981234428344,2.2598549610541614,2.152815183876615,5.365002020594019,3.227389846059315,2.7623123351496353,2.965214599643611,2.931754229079929,2.6904926307259824,1.9624167136570156,2.0831513965644297,3.105274161177455,4.749547853093163]}}

{"reviewText":"When you need a no-nonsense leather strap that is not long, consider this. If you need something fancy, or want to sling your guitar low, or if you are a tall person, probably you want to skip this.I'm 5ft 8\" and I'm already using the longest setting with my acoustic that has a strap button on the heel of the neck as well as the end pin, and it's not like I'm trying to hold my guitar particularly low. If you are a tall person, or if you want to mimic Jimmy Page's posture or something, this is not for you.Apart from that, I have to say that the cost performance of this thing is really impressive (it's more so if I believe the \"made in Canada\" sticker on it). Hard to beat it as far as leather straps go. At 2.5 inches wide, it's comfortable, one-ply leather is reasonably pliable yet seems to be thick enough, and the looks of it is not that bad either. Sure, there should be nicer/better product, but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks.The only complaint I have is that a sticker that left some sticky residue was on the back side of the strap. Though it was not a big deal to remove the residue using rubbing alcohol and some  elbow grease, it would have been nice if I was able to use it without any extra work without worrying about some gummy sticky thing rubbed on the guitar.","overall":4.0,"label":2,"clean_text":"need nonsense leather strap long consider need something fancy want sling guitar low tall person probably want skip ft

{"reviewText":"You know, any time a company actually sticks a battery in the box with their product, it just puts a smile on my face. Planet Waves has not only made a great, small, easy to install and easy to use tuner, they included the battery. That's an A+ in my book.I've got a 12-string acoustic guitar. Pretty much every time I go to sit down and play, I would waste a good 5 minutes grabbing my old tuner, balancing it on my knee, and trying to tune up. With this head stock tuner sitting on the guitar, I just turn it on and quickly get in tune and down to the serious business of jamming. It truly makes the task many times easier. The display is easy to read. It's read when the string is way off and green when you're close, using lines on either side of the key/letter to indicate sharp or flat, or right smack dab in tune.If I had the money, I'd stick one of these on all my guitars. As it is, having it on my 12-string is going to save me hassle and time.
